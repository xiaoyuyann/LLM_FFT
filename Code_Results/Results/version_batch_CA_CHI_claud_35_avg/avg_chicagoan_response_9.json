    "disposable_income": "Chicago's median household income is approximately $62,097, with about 16.4% living below poverty level. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of household budgets, averaging 16% of income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "After accounting for housing, transportation, and other essential expenses, Chicago residents have limited discretionary spending. Higher taxes and fees would impact consumer spending, particularly affecting middle and lower-income households",
    "accessibility": "Chicago has extensive public transit (CTA and Metra) with 145 rail stations and comprehensive bus network. 82% of residents live within walking distance of public transit. 71.4% of households own cars, but downtown areas have lower car ownership",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that maintain transit affordability while improving service quality. 2. Consider moderate tax rates to fund transit without overly burdening residents. 3. Support driving fees to reduce congestion and fund transit improvements. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to increase system efficiency. 5. Select options that maintain reasonable car travel times for those who depend on driving. Selected proposals balance these factors while considering citywide income levels and transit dependency"
