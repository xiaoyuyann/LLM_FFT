    "discretionary_consumption": "Chicago residents spend approximately 33% of their income on housing and 16% on transportation. The remaining discretionary spending is sensitive to additional taxes and fees",
    "accessibility": "Chicago has extensive public transit (CTA and Metra) with 145 rail stations and comprehensive bus network. 28.2% of households are car-free, and 34% of commuters use public transit. Average commute time is 35 minutes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that maintain transit affordability while improving service. 2. Consider lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help transit-dependent populations. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion and fund transit. 4. Prefer moderate tax rates (1%) that can sustain services without overburdening residents. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times below 55 minutes. Selected proposals balance these factors while maintaining system sustainability"
