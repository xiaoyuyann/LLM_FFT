    "disposable_income": "Chicago's median household income is approximately $62,097, with about 17.3% of residents living below poverty line. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of household budgets, averaging 16% of income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "After accounting for housing, transportation, and other essential expenses, Chicago residents have limited discretionary income. Higher taxes and fees would impact consumer spending, particularly affecting lower and middle-income households",
    "accessibility": "Chicago has extensive public transit (CTA and Metra) with 145 rail stations and comprehensive bus network. 28.2% of households don't own cars. Average commute time is 35 minutes. Transit accessibility varies significantly across neighborhoods",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that maintain transit affordability while improving service quality. 2. Consider lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to support transit-dependent populations. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion without excessive burden. 4. Prefer moderate tax rates (1%) to sustain transit operations while limiting impact on discretionary spending. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 55 minutes while keeping driving costs manageable"
