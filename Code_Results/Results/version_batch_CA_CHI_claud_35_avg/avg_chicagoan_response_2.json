    "disposable_income": "Chicago's median household income is approximately $62,097, with about 17.3% of residents living below poverty level. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of household budgets, especially for lower-income residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Chicago residents spend approximately 33% of their income on housing and 16% on transportation. The remaining discretionary spending is sensitive to changes in taxes and transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Chicago has extensive public transit (CTA and Metra) with 145 rail stations and comprehensive bus network. 28.2% of households are car-free, making transit accessibility crucial. Average commute time is 35 minutes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that maintain transit affordability while improving service. 2. Consider lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help lower-income residents. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to reduce congestion and fund transit. 4. Prefer moderate tax rates (1.0%) that can sustain services without overly burdening residents. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times below 55 minutes while keeping fares affordable. Selected proposals balance these factors while maintaining system sustainability"
