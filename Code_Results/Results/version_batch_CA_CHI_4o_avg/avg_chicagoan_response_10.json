    "accessibility": "Chicago has a well-developed public transit system, but travel times can be long. Improving transit times and reducing congestion are important for accessibility. The city also faces significant traffic congestion, making efficient transit options crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes reducing travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while considering the impact of taxes on disposable income. Lower fares and driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability, while moderate taxes ensure sufficient funding for transit improvements. The goal is to balance affordability, efficiency, and accessibility, while minimizing the financial burden on residents."
