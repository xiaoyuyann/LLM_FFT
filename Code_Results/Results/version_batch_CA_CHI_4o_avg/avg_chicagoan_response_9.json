    "disposable_income": "The median household income in Chicago is around $60,000, with significant variation across neighborhoods. Many residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies important.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Chicagoans spend a significant portion of their income on housing, transportation, and food. Policies that increase transportation costs could reduce discretionary spending on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago has a well-developed public transit system, but accessibility varies by neighborhood. Policies that improve transit times and reduce costs could enhance access to jobs and services, especially for lower-income residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance affordability with improved transit service. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve air quality. A moderate sales tax supports transit without overly burdening residents. The top-ranked policies offer reduced transit times and costs, making them attractive for residents who rely on public transportation. The tradeoff involves balancing the need for revenue to improve transit with the financial burden on residents. Policies with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while a moderate sales tax ensures sustainable funding for transit improvements."
