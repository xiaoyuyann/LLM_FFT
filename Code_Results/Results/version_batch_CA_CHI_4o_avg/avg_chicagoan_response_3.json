    "disposable_income": "The median household income in Chicago is around $60,000. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with significant variation across different neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Chicago residents allocate a significant portion of their income to housing, transportation, and food. Discretionary spending is limited, especially in lower-income areas, making cost-sensitive policies important.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago has a well-developed public transit system, but accessibility varies. Lower-income areas may rely more on public transit, while higher-income areas may have more car ownership. Reducing transit times and costs can improve accessibility for transit-dependent populations.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance affordability, transit efficiency, and revenue generation for improved services. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents while encouraging transit use. Driver fees are considered to reduce congestion and emissions, with a focus on maintaining or improving transit travel times. The selected policies aim to enhance overall accessibility and service quality without disproportionately impacting low-income residents."
