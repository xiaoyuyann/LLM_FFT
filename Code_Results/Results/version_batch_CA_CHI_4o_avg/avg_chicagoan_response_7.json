    "disposable_income": "The median household income in Chicago is around $60,000. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with significant variation across different neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Chicago residents spend a significant portion of their income on housing, transportation, and food. Discretionary spending is limited, especially in lower-income areas, making cost-effective transportation options important.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago has a well-developed public transit system, but accessibility varies by neighborhood. Some areas are transit-rich, while others rely more on driving. Reducing travel time and cost for both modes is crucial for equitable access to resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes reducing travel time and costs for both transit and driving, while considering the impact of sales tax on disposable income. Lower fares and driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability, while moderate sales tax rates are chosen to support transit improvements without overly burdening residents. The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and accessibility improvements, benefiting a broad range of residents."
