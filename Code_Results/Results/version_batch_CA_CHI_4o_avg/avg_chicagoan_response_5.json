    "disposable_income": "The median household income in Chicago is around $60,000. This means that residents have a moderate level of disposable income, which is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, taxes, and fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Chicago residents allocate their income to various needs, including housing, food, and transportation. Any increase in transportation costs or taxes could reduce discretionary spending on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago has a well-developed public transit system, but travel times can be long. Improving transit times and reducing congestion are important for accessibility. However, costs must be balanced to ensure affordability for residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes reducing travel times and improving transit services while keeping costs manageable for residents. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to maintain affordability. Driver fees are considered to reduce congestion and encourage transit use. The selected policies aim to balance these factors, improving transit efficiency and accessibility without overly burdening residents financially."
