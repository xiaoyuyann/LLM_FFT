    "disposable_income": "The median household income in Chicago is around $60,000. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with significant variation across different neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Chicago residents allocate a significant portion of their income to housing, transportation, and food. Discretionary spending is limited, especially in lower-income areas, making cost-sensitive policies more appealing.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago has a well-developed public transit system, but accessibility varies by neighborhood. Lower-income areas may rely more on public transit, while higher-income areas may have better access to private vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance affordability with improved transit service. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents while enhancing transit accessibility. Policies that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are favored to improve overall efficiency and quality of life. The tradeoff involves balancing the need for revenue to support transit improvements with the financial impact on residents."
