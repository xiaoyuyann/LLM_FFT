    "disposable_income": "The median household income in Chicago is around $60,000. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with significant variation across different neighborhoods. Many residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, which can impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Chicago residents allocate a significant portion of their income to housing, food, and transportation. Discretionary spending is limited, so increases in transportation costs could reduce spending in other areas.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago has a well-developed public transit system, including buses and trains, which provides good accessibility to most areas. However, travel times can be long, and improvements in transit efficiency could benefit many residents. Car ownership is common, but congestion and parking are issues.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes reducing travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while considering the impact of taxes and fees on disposable income. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is sought to ensure sustainable funding for transit without overly burdening residents. The selected policies aim to improve transit efficiency, reduce car travel times, and maintain affordability."
