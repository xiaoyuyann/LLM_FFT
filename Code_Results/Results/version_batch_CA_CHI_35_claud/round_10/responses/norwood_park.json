    "disposable_income": "Norwood Park is an upper-middle-class area with median household income around $82,000. Residents have relatively high disposable income and car ownership rates. Many households can afford multiple vehicles.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending capacity. The area has high rates of homeownership and retail spending. A sales tax increase would have moderate but manageable impact on household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area is served by the CTA Blue Line and Metra, but is relatively car-dependent. Many residents commute downtown by transit but use cars for local trips. The area has good road infrastructure and ample parking.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance driving convenience with moderate improvements to transit, given high car usage but also transit commuting needs. 2. Can tolerate moderate driving fees to fund transit improvements since income levels are high. 3. Prefer lower sales tax rates since residents make significant retail purchases. 4. Support moderate transit fares that maintain service quality without excessive costs. 5. Selected policies that reduce both driving and transit travel times without extreme cost increases."
