    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge has a median household income of around $68,000, which is above Chicago's median. The area has a relatively stable middle-class population with moderate disposable income. Many residents work at Midway Airport or in related industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. The community has a high rate of homeownership and car ownership, suggesting stable but not excessive disposable income. Many households need to balance transportation costs with other expenses.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good road access due to proximity to major arteries and Midway Airport. Transit access is moderate, with CTA Orange Line at the eastern edge and some bus routes. Most residents rely on cars for daily transportation, with about 80% of households owning vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, avoid highest driving fees to prevent excessive burden on residents. 2. Moderate transit improvements needed but not at highest cost due to limited transit usage. 3. Lower sales tax preferred due to middle-class status and existing tax burden. 4. Balance between driving efficiency and transit improvement needed. 5. Selected proposals that maintain reasonable car costs while gradually improving transit without excessive taxation."
