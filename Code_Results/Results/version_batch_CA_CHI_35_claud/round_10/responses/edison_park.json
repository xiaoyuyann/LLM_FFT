    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is an affluent community with median household income around $87,000, significantly higher than Chicago's average. Most residents have substantial disposable income and can afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Residents generally own homes and cars, with retail spending patterns suggesting comfort with higher consumption taxes. The 1-1.5% sales tax increase would be manageable for most households",
    "accessibility": "Located on far northwest side, relatively car-dependent area with longer commute times to downtown. Has Metra station and some bus service but transit coverage is limited compared to more central areas. About 85% of residents drive to work, while only 15% use public transit",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency and income levels, policies that improve driving times without excessive fees are preferred\n2. Moderate transit improvements needed but not primary concern given usage patterns\n3. Can tolerate higher sales tax given income levels if it improves overall transportation\n4. Prefer balanced approach between driving fees and transit fares\n5. Selected policies that reduce car travel times to 17-19 minutes while keeping driving fees moderate\n6. Ranked proposals with 1% tax rate higher as 1.5% seems excessive for benefits gained\n7. Focused on proposals that maintain reasonable transit times for the minority who depend on it"
