    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $13,500. About 45% of households live below the poverty line, making residents extremely sensitive to any cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending. Most income goes to basic necessities. Any additional transportation costs or sales taxes would significantly impact already strained household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "Riverdale is relatively isolated with limited transit options. Many residents rely on public transit due to low car ownership rates (about 30% of households don't have vehicles). The community faces long travel times both by car and transit to reach jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest combined costs (low fares, low taxes) due to severe income constraints. 2. Need improved transit service but can't burden residents with high costs. 3. Favor proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) since many residents are transit-dependent. 4. Consider moderate driving fees to help fund transit improvements without directly impacting most residents. 5. Balance between service improvements and affordability, with affordability being paramount."
