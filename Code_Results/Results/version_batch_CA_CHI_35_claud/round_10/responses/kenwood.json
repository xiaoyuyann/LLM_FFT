    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity, with significant variation across income groups. Higher-income residents have more flexibility to absorb increased transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has good access to public transit with multiple bus routes and proximity to Green Line and Metra. Car ownership is moderate, and many residents use both transit and cars. The area has good access to Hyde Park, downtown, and lakefront amenities",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that don't overly burden lower-income residents while improving transit service. 2. Consider moderate tax rates that can fund transit improvements without excessive impact on discretionary spending. 3. Support driving fees to reduce congestion while keeping transit fares affordable. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit transit-dependent residents. 5. Balance between transit accessibility improvements and cost impacts on mixed-income population"
