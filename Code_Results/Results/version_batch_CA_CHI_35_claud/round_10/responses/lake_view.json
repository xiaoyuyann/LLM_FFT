Many residents commute to downtown. Car ownership is lower than city average, with many households being car-free by choice.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that improve transit service given high transit usage in area\n2. Higher income means community can tolerate higher fees/taxes for better service\n3. Focus on reducing transit travel times since many residents are transit-dependent\n4. Support policies with higher driving fees to reduce congestion\n5. Balance between service improvements and maintaining reasonable transit fares\n6. Selected proposals 26, 23, 14, 20, and 8 as they offer best transit times while using mix of funding sources"
