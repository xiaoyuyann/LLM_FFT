    "disposable_income": "Washington Heights has a median household income of approximately $41,000, which is below Chicago's median. Many residents face economic constraints, making them sensitive to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels. Residents need to carefully balance essential expenses with transportation costs. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "The community has access to Metra stations and bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles. The area is somewhat transit-dependent, with about 30% of households not owning cars. Travel times to employment centers are significant consideration",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares and sales tax due to limited disposable income. 2. Balance driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel time to improve accessibility. 4. Focus on options that maintain reasonable car travel times for car-dependent residents. 5. Selected proposals that minimize overall cost burden while maximizing service improvements"
