    "disposable_income": "Near North Side has one of the highest median household incomes in Chicago (over $100,000). Residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending, with numerous luxury retail, dining, and entertainment venues. Residents typically spend more on goods/services, meaning sales tax impact is proportionally larger",
    "accessibility": "Excellent transit access with multiple L lines, bus routes, and walkable streets. High car ownership but also high transit usage due to density and proximity to downtown. Heavy traffic congestion during peak hours",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, can tolerate higher fees/taxes to improve service. 2. Dense urban area benefits from reduced congestion. 3. Mixed transit/driving population needs balanced improvements. 4. Higher driver fees acceptable to reduce congestion. 5. Prefer policies that significantly improve transit times. Selected policies balance revenue generation with service improvements, focusing on reduced congestion and better transit performance while accepting higher costs given the area's affluence"
