    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $25,000, with 43% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates very limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Most income goes to essential needs, making them highly sensitive to any additional transportation costs or taxes",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with Pink Line stations and bus routes, but 36% of households don't own vehicles. Many residents are transit-dependent. Average commute times are higher than city average",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high poverty rates, prioritize lowest fares and taxes to preserve limited disposable income. 2. Need balance of affordable transit access for transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality. 3. Lower driving fees preferred as many essential workers need cars but can't afford high fees. 4. Selected proposals that minimize combined burden of fares/fees/taxes while maintaining reasonable service levels. 5. Ranked proposals with 0.5-1.0% tax rates higher than 1.5% to avoid excessive burden on limited discretionary spending"
