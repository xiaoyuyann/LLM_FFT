    "disposable_income": "The Loop has one of the highest median household incomes in Chicago, with many residents working in professional and financial services. The average household income is well above $100,000, indicating high disposable income and ability to absorb transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power, with high levels of retail, dining, and entertainment expenditure. The impact of sales tax increases would be noticeable but manageable given the income levels",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent transit accessibility with multiple L lines, Metra stations, and bus routes. It also has high walkability scores. While many residents own cars, transit is a viable and widely-used option. Traffic congestion is a major concern during peak hours",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, can prioritize time savings over cost savings. 2. Heavy transit infrastructure suggests policies supporting transit use would be beneficial. 3. Congestion is a major issue, so policies that reduce car usage through fees are acceptable. 4. Higher sales tax is tolerable given income levels if it improves transit. 5. Prefer balanced approaches that improve both transit and driving times. Selected policies that maximize time savings while keeping costs at moderate levels, with preference for proposals that reduce congestion through driving fees"
