    "disposable_income": "Beverly is an upper-middle-class community with median household income around $94,000. Residents have relatively high disposable income compared to Chicago average, making them less sensitive to moderate fare/fee increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Many households can afford cars and have significant retail spending. Higher sales tax would impact discretionary purchases but not severely given income levels",
    "accessibility": "Beverly has Metra Rock Island line stations but limited CTA rail access. Many residents are car-dependent for commuting. Good road network with connection to major highways. Mixed transit-car usage patterns with higher car ownership rates",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given Beverly's car dependency but mixed transit usage, prefer balanced policies that improve both modes\n2. Higher income means moderate fee increases are acceptable if they improve service\n3. Prefer policies with moderate sales tax (1%) as community has significant retail spending\n4. Look for proposals that reduce transit travel times to boost its competitiveness\n5. Prioritize proposals that reduce driving times given many car commuters\n6. Selected proposals 14, 23, 13, 5, 4 as they offer good balance of improved travel times for both modes while keeping costs reasonable"
