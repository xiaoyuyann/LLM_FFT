    "disposable_income": "South Deering has a median household income of approximately $31,200, which is significantly lower than Chicago's median. About 32% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income and high poverty rate, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households struggle with basic necessities, making them highly sensitive to any additional transportation costs or taxes",
    "accessibility": "The area is relatively isolated with limited public transit options. Many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the industrial nature of the area and distance from downtown. The community has lower transit accessibility compared to North Side neighborhoods, with longer average commute times",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest combined costs (tax + fare/fee) due to low income levels\n2. Consider both transit and driving times since residents use both modes\n3. Favor proposals with lower transit fares to help transit-dependent residents\n4. Avoid highest driving fees since many residents require cars for work\n5. Balance between service improvements and cost burden\nSelected proposals that minimize financial burden while providing reasonable service levels, with emphasis on keeping transit affordable"
