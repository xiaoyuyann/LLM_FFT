    "disposable_income": "Calumet Heights has a median household income of around $48,000, which is moderate for Chicago. The community has a significant middle-class population with many homeowners, but also contains households with more limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. Many households need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. The 1.5% tax rate would notably impact household budgets given the consumption patterns",
    "accessibility": "The area is served by the Metra Electric District line and several bus routes, but many residents rely on cars due to the somewhat limited transit coverage. The community is relatively far from downtown, making travel times and costs particularly important considerations",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize moderate tax rates to balance transit funding with household budgets\n2. Favor policies with lower transit fares since many residents use public transit for commuting\n3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents\n4. Consider travel time improvements for both transit and driving given the area's distance from downtown\n5. Select policies that provide good transit service while keeping costs manageable for middle-income households"
