    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class community with median household income around $41,000, significantly below Chicago's average. Many residents work in service and manufacturing sectors, with about 18% of families below poverty level",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to low income levels. Residents are price-sensitive to both transit fares and sales taxes. Many households spend significant portion of income on basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "High transit dependency with about 20% of households without vehicles. Located along Orange Line and multiple bus routes. Many residents commute to jobs in other parts of city. Mixed transit and driving usage but transit accessibility is crucial",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low income levels\n2. Moderate sales tax preferred to balance transit funding and household budgets\n3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent households\n4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve job accessibility\n5. Consider combined impact of all fees/taxes on household budgets"
