    "disposable_income": "Burnside has a median household income of approximately $31,000, significantly below Chicago's average. About 30% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity. Most income goes to essential needs, making them highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees",
    "accessibility": "Burnside has moderate transit access with bus services and proximity to Metra Electric line. About 30% of households don't own vehicles and rely on public transit. Many residents are transit-dependent for accessing jobs and services",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize proposals with lower fares and taxes to preserve disposable income. 2. Need balance between transit service quality and affordability since many residents are transit-dependent. 3. Lower driving fees preferred as many working residents need cars for job access. 4. Selected proposals that minimize total travel costs while maintaining reasonable transit service levels. 5. Ranked proposals with 0.5-1.0% tax rates higher than 1.5% to limit impact on discretionary spending"
