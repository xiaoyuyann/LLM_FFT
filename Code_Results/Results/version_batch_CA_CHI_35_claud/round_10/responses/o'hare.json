    "disposable_income": "O'Hare has a median household income above city average, with many residents working in aviation, hospitality, and related industries. The community can generally absorb moderate transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity. Many households own cars and regularly make purchases at nearby commercial centers and shopping destinations",
    "accessibility": "The area has good highway access (I-90, I-294) and Blue Line service, but transit times are longer due to distance from downtown. Most residents rely on cars, but airport workers often use transit. The community has high car ownership rates but also significant transit commuting",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance driving efficiency with reasonable transit options given mixed-mode usage. 2. Can accept moderate tax increases given income levels. 3. Prefer policies that reduce car travel times due to high car dependency. 4. Consider moderate driving fees to fund improvements while keeping transit affordable for airport workers. 5. Selected policies that optimize both modes while maintaining reasonable costs"
