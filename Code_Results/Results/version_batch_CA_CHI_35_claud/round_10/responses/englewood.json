    "disposable_income": "Englewood has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $20,000 annually. Many residents live below poverty level and have very limited disposable income. Cost sensitivity is extremely high.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary spending is minimal. Most household income goes to basic necessities. Even small increases in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact residents' ability to meet basic needs.",
    "accessibility": "High transit dependency with lower car ownership rates compared to city average. Many residents rely on public transit to access jobs, services, and essential resources. Current transit service is limited with longer travel times. Walking and bus are primary modes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest combined costs (fare + tax) given very low incomes\n2. Focus on improved transit service/times since many depend on transit\n3. Avoid high driving fees since they would burden working families with cars\n4. Balance between service improvements and affordability\n5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping fares low\nRanked #0 first as it has lowest tax and fare burden. #9 second as it maintains low fares with moderate service. #3 third as compromise option. #18 fourth improves service while keeping fares low. #10 fifth as balanced option with moderate improvements."
