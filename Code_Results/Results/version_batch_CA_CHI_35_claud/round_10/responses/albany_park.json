    "disposable_income": "Albany Park has a median household income of approximately $57,000, which is slightly below Chicago's median. About 15% of residents live below poverty level, indicating a significant portion of the population has limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a significant portion of income on essential needs, making them sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "The area is well-served by public transit with the Brown Line, multiple bus routes, and relatively good access to major arterials. About 35% of residents use public transit for commuting, while 45% drive. Many residents are transit-dependent",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to support transit-dependent population and moderate-income residents. 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) balances transit funding needs with household budget constraints. 3. Support driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service while managing congestion. 4. Consider travel time improvements for both transit and driving given mixed-mode usage. 5. Balance overall cost burden on residents while maintaining service quality"
