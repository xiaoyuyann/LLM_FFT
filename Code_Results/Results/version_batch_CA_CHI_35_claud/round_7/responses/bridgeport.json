    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a median household income of around $54,000, which is slightly below Chicago's median. About 15% of residents live below poverty level. This suggests moderate sensitivity to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Many households need to carefully budget for transportation costs. The community has a mix of working-class and middle-class families who would be impacted by higher taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "Bridgeport has decent transit access with Red Line, Orange Line, and several bus routes. About 30% of residents use public transit for commuting, while 60% drive. The community has good road access to downtown and other areas via major arterials.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that don't overly burden either drivers or transit users given mixed mode usage. 2. Favor moderate tax rates since many residents have limited discretionary income. 3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service while keeping fares affordable. 4. Look for policies that reduce travel times for both modes. 5. Selected policies 13, 10, 4, 21, and 19 as they offer good balance of costs and travel time improvements for both modes while maintaining affordability."
