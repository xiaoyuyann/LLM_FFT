    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a lower median household income around $27,000, with about 39% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary spending is very limited. Residents need to prioritize essential expenses like housing, food, and transportation. Higher taxes or fees would significantly impact already constrained budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with Green and Red Line stations and multiple bus routes. About 42% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. Average commute times are higher than city average, indicating transportation challenges.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fare + tax) while maintaining service quality. 2. Many residents are transit-dependent, so transit travel times are critical. 3. Lower transit fares are more important than driving fees since many don't own cars. 4. Moderate tax rate balances revenue needs with resident affordability. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping fares affordable. Ranked proposals prioritizing $0.75 fares with moderate improvements in transit times."
