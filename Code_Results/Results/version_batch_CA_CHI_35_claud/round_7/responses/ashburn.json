    "disposable_income": "Ashburn has a median household income of around $65,000, which is slightly above Chicago's median. However, with significant homeownership costs and family expenses, residents are cost-sensitive to transportation expenses",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Moderate discretionary spending capacity, with many working-class and middle-class families. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets, especially for larger families common in this area",
    "accessibility": "Heavily car-dependent community with limited public transit options. Most residents rely on personal vehicles, though some use Metra Rock Island line at the edge of the neighborhood. Distance from downtown makes transportation costs and time significant factors",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that keep driving costs manageable given car dependency\n2. Prefer lower sales tax rates due to impact on family budgets\n3. Balance transit improvements without excessive costs\n4. Consider policies that improve transit without severely penalizing driving\n5. Focus on options that reduce travel times while keeping overall costs reasonable"
