    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class community with median household income around $41,000, significantly below Chicago's average. Many residents work in service and manufacturing sectors, with limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. A high percentage of income goes to essential needs like housing, food, and transportation. Higher taxes or fees would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "The community has moderate transit access with CTA buses and Orange Line nearby. Car ownership is important for many residents who work in dispersed locations. About 75% of households own at least one vehicle, but many are sensitive to driving costs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents\n2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) due to limited discretionary income\n3. Accept moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers\n4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on working families\n5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel times without excessive costs"
