    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $25,000, with 43% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates very limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Most income goes to essential needs, making them highly sensitive to any additional transportation costs or taxes",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with Pink Line stations and bus routes, but 40% of households don't own vehicles. Many residents are transit-dependent and face long commute times to jobs and services",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high poverty rates, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain accessibility\n2. Keep sales tax low (0.5-1.0%) as residents have limited purchasing power\n3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers\n4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost burden on low-income residents\n5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping fares affordable"
