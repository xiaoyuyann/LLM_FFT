    "disposable_income": "McKinley Park is a working-class neighborhood with median household income around $47,000, below Chicago's average. Many residents work in manufacturing and service industries, making them sensitive to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to moderate income levels. Residents need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. Annual retail spending estimated around $20,000 per household",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by public transit with Orange Line and multiple bus routes. Mixed transit/driving community with 72% of households owning cars but significant transit usage. Close to downtown and industrial corridors requiring reliable commute options",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares and moderate taxes given income constraints. 2. Balance driving fees to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent workers. 3. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel times to support commuters. 4. Favor options that maintain reasonable driving costs for manufacturing workers. 5. Select policies that provide good transit service while keeping overall costs manageable for working families"
