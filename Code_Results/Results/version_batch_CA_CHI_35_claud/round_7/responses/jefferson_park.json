    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-class community with median household income around $71,000. Many residents are working professionals and city workers. The area has relatively high homeownership rates and stable housing costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending power but are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees. Many households have significant expenses related to housing, transportation, and family needs.",
    "accessibility": "The area is well-served by public transit with the Jefferson Park Transit Center (Blue Line, Metra, buses). However, many residents still rely on cars for work commutes and daily errands. The community has good road access via I-90 and major arterials.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced options that don't overly burden middle-class residents with high taxes/fees\n2. Consider strong transit presence but acknowledge car dependency for many trips\n3. Look for proposals that improve both transit and driving times without excessive costs\n4. Favor moderate fare increases over high sales tax due to impact on overall household budgets\n5. Select options that maintain reasonable transit access for transit-dependent residents"
