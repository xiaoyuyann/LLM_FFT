    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Square is a middle to upper-middle income area with median household income around $77,000. Residents have moderate disposable income but are price-sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has significant retail and entertainment spending, with many local businesses, restaurants, and shopping districts. Residents generally have good discretionary spending power but are value-conscious.",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by CTA Brown Line, multiple bus routes, and major arterial roads. High transit usage (40%+ commuters), significant walking/biking, but also considerable car ownership. Good mix of transportation options.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that maintain good transit service while keeping costs moderate for both transit and driving users. 2. Favor proposals with moderate sales tax (1%) as community has retail spending but wants to maintain local business vitality. 3. Support modest driver fees to reduce congestion but avoid highest fees that could hurt local businesses. 4. Look for proposals that improve transit times without excessive fare increases. 5. Selected proposals 13, 10, 4, 14, and 16 as they offer good transit time improvements, reasonable costs, and balanced funding approach."
