    "disposable_income": "Washington Heights has a median household income of approximately $41,000, which is below Chicago's median. Many residents have limited disposable income and are sensitive to transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets. Many families need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "The community has access to Metra Rail (95th Street station) and several bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles. About 75% of households own cars, though transit dependency is significant among lower-income residents",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on household budgets. 2. Favor moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable for dependent riders. 3. Consider moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden given mixed-mode usage. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs manageable for lower-income households"
