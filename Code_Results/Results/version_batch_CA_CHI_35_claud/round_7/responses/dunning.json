    "disposable_income": "Dunning is a middle-class community with median household income around $65,000-70,000. Most residents are working professionals and families with moderate disposable income. The area has relatively high car ownership rates.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity but are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees. Many households own cars and regularly make purchases in nearby commercial areas, making them susceptible to both transportation costs and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "Dunning is a more car-dependent community on Chicago's northwest side. Transit access is limited mainly to bus services, with longer travel times to downtown. Most residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities. The area has good road infrastructure but experiences some congestion during peak hours.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that maintain reasonable driving costs while improving transit service, given high car dependency\n2. Balance moderate sales tax rates to avoid excessive burden on household purchases\n3. Support policies that reduce congestion and improve travel times for both modes\n4. Consider lower transit fares to encourage occasional transit use as alternative\n5. Favor proposals that offer best overall value for middle-class household budgets"
