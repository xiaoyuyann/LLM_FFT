    "disposable_income": "Brighton Park is a working-class community with median household income around $43,000, significantly below Chicago's median. Many residents work in manufacturing and service sectors, with about 18% of families below poverty level",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels. Residents are price-sensitive to both transit fares and sales tax increases. Many households spend significant portion of income on basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "Good bus service along major arterials, access to Orange Line at Kedzie and Western stations. About 30% of households don't own vehicles and rely on public transit. Many residents commute to jobs in other parts of the city",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to high transit dependency and limited income\n2. Moderate sales tax preferred as higher rates would burden low-income residents\n3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent workers\n4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on residents\n5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel time to improve access to jobs"
