    "disposable_income": "Fuller Park has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $21,000. The poverty rate is approximately 40%, indicating very limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high poverty rate and low income levels, discretionary spending is extremely limited. Most household income goes to basic necessities like housing, food, and utilities. Even small increases in transportation costs or taxes would significantly impact residents' ability to meet basic needs.",
    "accessibility": "Fuller Park has relatively good transit access with Red Line and Green Line stations and several bus routes. Car ownership rates are low due to economic constraints. Many residents rely heavily on public transit for accessing jobs, services and resources.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given very low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fares, taxes, fees). 2. Strong transit dependency means better transit service times are important. 3. Lower transit fares are critical for affordability. 4. Lower sales tax preferred due to impact on basic goods. 5. Driving fees less impactful since car ownership is low. Selected policies balance minimal costs with improved transit service: Policy 0 has lowest costs overall, Policy 9 maintains low fares with moderate improvements, Policy 3 keeps low tax with reasonable service, Policy 18 offers good transit times with low fares, Policy 1 provides improved transit times while maintaining affordability."
