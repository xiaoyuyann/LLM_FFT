    "disposable_income": "Austin has a median household income of approximately $33,000, significantly below Chicago's average. About 30% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households struggle with basic necessities, making them highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees",
    "accessibility": "Austin has good access to public transit with Green Line L and multiple bus routes. However, about 65% of residents rely on personal vehicles. The community faces longer than average commute times, with many residents traveling to jobs outside the area",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and taxes to protect disposable income. 2. Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Balance between travel time improvements and cost burden. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time to help the significant transit-dependent population. 5. Selected proposals 0, 9, 1, 10, and 3 as they offer the best combination of low fares/taxes while still providing service improvements"
