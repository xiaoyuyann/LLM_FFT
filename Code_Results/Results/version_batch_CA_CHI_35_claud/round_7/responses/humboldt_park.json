    "disposable_income": "Humboldt Park has a median household income of approximately $37,000, significantly below Chicago's median. About 28% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a large portion of income on basic necessities, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs and sales taxes",
    "accessibility": "About 35% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes and proximity to Blue Line, but many residents face long commute times. Many residents work in service jobs requiring off-peak travel",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Prefer lower sales tax rates as residents have limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening working drivers. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs affordable for low-income residents"
