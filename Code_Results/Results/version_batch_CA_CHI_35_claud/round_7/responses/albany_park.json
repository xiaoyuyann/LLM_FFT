    "disposable_income": "Albany Park has a median household income of approximately $57,000, which is slightly below Chicago's median. About 15% of residents live below poverty level, indicating a significant portion of the population has limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a significant portion of income on essential needs, making them sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "The area is well-served by public transit with the Brown Line, multiple bus routes, and relatively good access to major arterials. About 36% of residents use public transit for commuting, 45% drive, and others walk or bike. Many residents are transit-dependent",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents and moderate-income families. 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) balances transit funding needs with household budget impacts. 3. Support driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service and reduce congestion, but not the highest combinations to avoid overburdening working families. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 55 minutes. 5. Consider balance between car and transit improvements given mixed-mode usage in the area"
