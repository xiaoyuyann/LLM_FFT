    "disposable_income": "Hermosa is a working-class community with median household income around $45,000, significantly below Chicago's average. Many residents work in service and manufacturing sectors, with limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets. Many families need to carefully balance essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with bus routes and proximity to Blue Line, but many residents rely on cars for work commutes. About 75% of households own vehicles, but transportation costs are a significant burden",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares and sales tax due to limited disposable income. 2. Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent workers. 3. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on working families. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time to benefit transit-dependent residents. 5. Consider proposals that maintain reasonable car travel times for workers needing vehicles"
