    "disposable_income": "Armour Square has a median household income of approximately $35,000, significantly below Chicago's average. The community has a high percentage of low-income residents and seniors, making them particularly sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels. Many residents spend a large portion of their income on basic necessities. The community has a high concentration of Asian Americans, particularly in Chinatown, where local businesses depend on accessibility for customers",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with Red Line L station and multiple bus routes. About 40% of households don't own cars. The community heavily relies on public transit for commuting and accessing services. Many residents work in service jobs requiring off-peak travel",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and lower incomes. 2. Prefer lower sales tax rates as residents have limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening local businesses. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on residents. 5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel time to improve access to jobs and services"
