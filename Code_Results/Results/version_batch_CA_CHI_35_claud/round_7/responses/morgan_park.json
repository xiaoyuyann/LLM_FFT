    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a median household income of approximately $57,000, which is moderate for Chicago. About 15% of residents live below poverty level, indicating a significant portion of the population needs to be mindful of transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending power. The community has a mix of middle-class and working-class households, with many homeowners but also renters who need to carefully budget transportation expenses",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park is served by Metra Rock Island Line and several bus routes, but is relatively far from L train service. Many residents rely on personal vehicles due to longer transit times to reach downtown and other employment centers. The area has good road access via I-57 and major arterials",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance transit improvement with moderate costs given mixed-income population. 2. Consider driving costs since many residents commute by car due to distance from downtown. 3. Favor lower sales tax rates to protect discretionary spending. 4. Look for policies that improve transit times without excessive fare increases. 5. Selected policies 10, 11, 4, 1, and 13 as they offer good transit time improvements while keeping costs moderate through balanced combinations of fees"
