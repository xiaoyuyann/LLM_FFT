    "disposable_income": "Beverly is an upper-middle-class community with median household income around $94,000. Residents have relatively high disposable income compared to Chicago average, making them less sensitive to moderate fare/fee increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Many households can afford cars and have flexibility in transportation choices. Higher sales tax impact is notable but manageable given income levels",
    "accessibility": "Beverly has both Metra Rock Island Line stations and some bus services. Many residents are car-dependent due to suburban-like layout. Good road access but transit coverage could be improved. About 80% of households own cars",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that improve both driving and transit times since Beverly residents use both modes\n2. Community can absorb moderate cost increases given income levels\n3. Focus on balanced approaches with middle-range taxes/fees to fund improvements\n4. Favor policies that reduce driving times since many residents commute by car\n5. Consider policies that improve transit service while keeping costs reasonable\n6. Selected proposals 14, 23, 13, 22, and 5 as they offer good balance of improved travel times, moderate cost increases, and sustainable funding"
