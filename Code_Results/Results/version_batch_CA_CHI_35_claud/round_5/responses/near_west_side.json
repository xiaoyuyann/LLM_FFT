Focus on reducing transit travel times given high transit usage in area\n3. Support moderate driving fees to reduce congestion while not overly burdening drivers\n4. Consider lower sales tax options to protect discretionary spending\n5. Favor proposals that improve both transit and driving times given multimodal nature of area"
