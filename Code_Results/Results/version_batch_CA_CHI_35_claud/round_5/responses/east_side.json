    "disposable_income": "East Side is a working-class community with median household income around $47,000, below Chicago's average. Many residents work in manufacturing and industrial jobs, with significant budget constraints",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels. Residents are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees. Many households need to carefully budget for basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "Heavy reliance on both cars and public transit. Many residents commute to industrial jobs, some requiring car access. The area has bus services but limited rail access. Average commute times are significant factor",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower taxes and fees due to limited disposable income. 2. Balance between transit improvements and driving costs since community uses both modes. 3. Favor proposals with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to preserve purchasing power. 4. Consider moderate driver fees to improve transit without excessive burden. 5. Prefer lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable. Selected proposals that minimize financial impact while providing reasonable service improvements"
