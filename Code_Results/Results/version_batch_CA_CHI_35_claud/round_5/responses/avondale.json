    "disposable_income": "Avondale has a median household income of around $57,000, which is slightly below Chicago's median. About 15% of residents live below poverty level, suggesting moderate financial constraints for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets significantly. Many residents need to balance essential expenses with transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Avondale has good access to CTA Blue Line and multiple bus routes. About 35% of residents use public transit for commuting, while 55% drive. The area has mixed transit-driving usage patterns, with many residents relying on both modes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending for moderate-income residents. 2. Balance transit fares around $1.25 to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit large transit-using population. 5. Consider proposals that maintain reasonable driving times for the majority who drive"
