    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is an affluent area with median household income around $106,000, well above Chicago average. Residents have relatively high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Most households own cars and have significant retail spending. Higher sales tax would have moderate but manageable impact on consumption",
    "accessibility": "Predominantly car-dependent suburban-style neighborhood with lower transit access compared to city average. Most residents drive, with 85%+ car ownership. Limited bus service and distance from L trains makes transit less convenient",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency and income levels, policies that improve driving times without excessive fees are preferred. 2. Higher sales tax is acceptable if it improves overall transportation. 3. Transit improvements still valuable as secondary option. 4. Selected policies balance moderate driving fees to reduce congestion while maintaining reasonable transit fares. 5. Focus on options that reduce car travel times since most residents drive. Ranked proposals that combine moderate tax increases with reasonable driving fees to improve both modes while avoiding extreme costs"
