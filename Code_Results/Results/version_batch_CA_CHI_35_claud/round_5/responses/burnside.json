    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower taxes and fares to preserve disposable income. 2. Need balance between transit improvement and cost burden since many residents rely on public transit. 3. Lower driving fees preferred as many working residents need cars for employment. 4.
