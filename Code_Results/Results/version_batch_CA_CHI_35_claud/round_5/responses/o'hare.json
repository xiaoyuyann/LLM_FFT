    "disposable_income": "O'Hare has a median household income above city average, with many residents working in aviation and hospitality industries. The area has relatively high disposable income due to stable employment from the airport and surrounding businesses",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity. Many households can afford car ownership and regular transit use. The community has significant retail spending at airport-adjacent shopping centers and restaurants",
    "accessibility": "The area has good highway access (I-90, I-294) and Blue Line transit service. Most residents rely on cars due to suburban layout, but the Blue Line provides critical airport and downtown connections. Many work trips are local to the airport complex",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance driving efficiency with moderate fees since many residents drive\n2. Support policies with moderate transit fares to maintain Blue Line service quality\n3. Prefer lower sales tax rates since area has high retail spending\n4. Consider policies that reduce congestion around airport area\n5. Value proposals that maintain reasonable transit times for airport workers\nSelected proposals balance these needs while minimizing impact on disposable income"
