Car ownership and usage rates are high, with most households owning at least one vehicle. Many residents commute by car to work.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) due to moderate disposable income and regular local spending. 2. Consider moderate driving fees ($0.50) as many residents drive but could benefit from reduced congestion. 3. Support moderate transit fares ($1.25) to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable. 4. Balance between car and transit improvements as both modes are important. 5. Avoid highest tax/fee combinations to protect discretionary spending power."
