    "disposable_income": "McKinley Park is a working-class neighborhood with median household income around $47,000, below Chicago's average. Many residents work in manufacturing and service industries, making them sensitive to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to moderate income levels. Residents need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. Higher sales taxes would notably impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by public transit with Orange Line and multiple bus routes. Mixed transit-car usage pattern - about 30% use public transit for commuting. Close to major highways but also good transit access to downtown and industrial corridors",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares and moderate taxes given income constraints. 2. Balance driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel times to support working population. 4. Avoid highest tax rates due to impact on discretionary spending. 5. Select options that maintain reasonable car travel times while improving transit"
