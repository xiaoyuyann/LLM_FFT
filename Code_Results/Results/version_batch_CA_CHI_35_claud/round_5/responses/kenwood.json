    "disposable_income": "Kenwood has a mixed-income population with a median household income around $45,000, though there are also affluent areas. About 20% of residents live below poverty line, so transportation costs are significant for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Significant variation in discretionary spending power across the community. Many residents need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. Higher-income areas have more flexibility in absorbing increased costs",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by CTA buses and Green Line, with good access to downtown. About 35% of residents rely on public transit for commuting. Relatively high car ownership rates compared to adjacent areas. Close to Lake Shore Drive for drivers",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced options that don't overly burden lower-income residents while maintaining service quality. 2. Consider the significant transit-dependent population needs affordable fares. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without excessive impact. 4. Look for options with lower sales tax to protect discretionary spending. 5. Value proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit commuters. Selected proposals balance these factors while considering the community's mixed socioeconomic composition"
