    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon is a working-class community with median household income around $51,000, lower than Chicago average. Many residents work in service and industrial jobs, making them sensitive to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to moderate income levels. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets. Many families need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "High car dependency with about 90% of households owning vehicles. Limited direct transit access with only bus services. Many residents commute to jobs in other parts of the city. Average commute times are significant factor in transportation choices",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and limited transit options, policies with lower driving fees are preferred. 2. Lower sales tax (0.5%) prioritized due to limited discretionary income. 3. Moderate transit fares ($1.25) balance revenue needs with affordability. 4. Policies that reduce driving times without excessive costs are valued. 5. Selected proposals maintain reasonable transit service while minimizing financial burden on working families"
