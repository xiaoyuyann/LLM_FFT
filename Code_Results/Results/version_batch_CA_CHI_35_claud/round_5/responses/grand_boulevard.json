    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a lower median household income around $27,000, with about 39% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary spending is very limited. Residents need to carefully balance essential needs like housing, food, and transportation. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact already constrained budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to CTA bus/rail services, with about 45% of residents using public transit for commuting. Car ownership is lower than city average at around 50% of households. The community relies heavily on affordable public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to fund transit while managing congestion. 4. Balance improved transit times with cost burden. 5. Consider high transit dependency in the community. Selected proposals optimize for low transit costs while maintaining service quality through modest driving fees and taxes."
