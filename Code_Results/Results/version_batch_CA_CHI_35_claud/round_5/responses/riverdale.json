    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $13,178. About 56% of households live below the poverty line, making residents extremely sensitive to any cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending. Most income goes to basic necessities. Any additional transportation costs or sales taxes would significantly impact already strained household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "Riverdale is relatively isolated with limited transit options. Many residents rely on public transit due to low car ownership rates (about 30% of households don't have vehicles). The community faces some of the longest commute times in the city.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service without directly burdening transit users. 4. Balance between improved transit times and keeping costs low for residents. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while maintaining affordability."
