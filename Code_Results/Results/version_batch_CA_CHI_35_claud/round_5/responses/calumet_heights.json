    "disposable_income": "Calumet Heights has a median household income of around $48,000, which is moderate for Chicago. The community has a significant middle-class population with stable employment, but many residents need to be mindful of transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. The community has a mix of homeowners and renters, with transportation costs representing a notable portion of household budgets. Higher sales taxes would impact household purchasing power",
    "accessibility": "The area is served by the Metra Electric District line and several bus routes, but many residents rely on cars. The community is somewhat distant from downtown, making commute times and transportation reliability important factors. Car ownership is relatively high compared to city average",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced options that don't overly burden residents with high taxes or fees, given moderate income levels. 2. Consider options that improve transit service without excessive fare increases, as many residents use public transit. 3. Look for proposals that reduce travel times while keeping costs reasonable. 4. Favor policies that maintain driving affordability while encouraging transit use. 5. Selected proposals 10, 13, 4, 19, and 1 as they offer good balance of improved transit service, moderate costs, and reduced travel times"
