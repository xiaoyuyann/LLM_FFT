    "disposable_income": "South Deering has a median household income of approximately $31,200, which is significantly below Chicago's median. About 32% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a large portion of their income on basic necessities, making them particularly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees",
    "accessibility": "The area is relatively isolated with limited public transit options. Many residents rely on cars due to the industrial nature of the area and distance from downtown. The area has some bus services but no L train stations nearby. Average commute times are longer than city average",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower taxes and fees to protect disposable income. 2. Need balance between transit improvement and cost burden since many residents use both modes. 3. Favor proposals that reduce transit times without excessive cost increases. 4. Selected proposal 0 first as it has lowest tax and fare burden. 5. Chose proposal 9 second as moderate tax helps transit while keeping fares low. 6. Proposal 3 ranked third with low tax but moderate fare. 7. Proposal 10 fourth as it improves transit times with moderate costs. 8. Proposal 1 fifth as it maintains low fares while slightly improving service"
