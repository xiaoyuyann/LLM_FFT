    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is an affluent community with median household income around $87,000, significantly higher than Chicago's average. Most residents have substantial disposable income and can afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Residents generally own homes and cars, with retail spending patterns suggesting comfort with higher consumption taxes. The 1-1.5% sales tax increase would be manageable for most households",
    "accessibility": "Located on far northwest side, heavily car-dependent with longer commutes to downtown. Has Metra station and some bus service but transit times are lengthy. Over 90% of households own cars, with driving being primary mode. Good road access but faces regular congestion",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and usage, policies reducing car travel times are priority. 2. Community can absorb higher costs, so willing to pay for better service. 3. Higher driver fees acceptable if they reduce congestion. 4. Moderate transit fares preferred to maintain option for workers. 5. Higher tax rates acceptable if they improve overall transportation system. Selected policies that balance reduced car travel times with reasonable cost increases, prioritizing proposals with $0.50-$1.00 driver fees to manage congestion"
