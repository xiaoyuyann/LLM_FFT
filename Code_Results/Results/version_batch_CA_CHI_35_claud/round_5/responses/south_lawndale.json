    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a relatively low median household income around $36,000, with about 28% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. The community has high price sensitivity for both sales tax and transit fares. Many households spend a significant portion of income on basic necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to CTA Pink Line and multiple bus routes. About 35% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. The community has a high proportion of workers using public transportation for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fare + tax) while maintaining service quality. 2. Strong transit dependency means transit service levels and affordability are crucial. 3. Lower fares ($0.75) benefit the large transit-dependent population. 4. Moderate driving fees can help improve transit service without overly burdening car-owning households. 5. Lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) preferred due to limited discretionary spending."
