    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a median household income of approximately $57,000, which is moderate for Chicago. About 15% of residents live below poverty level, indicating a significant portion of the population needs to be mindful of transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets. Many households need to balance essential expenses with transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park is served by Metra Rock Island Line but has limited CTA rail access. Many residents rely on cars for mobility. The community has a higher car ownership rate than the city average, but also has transit-dependent populations",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance driving and transit costs given mixed transportation needs. 2. Avoid highest tax rates due to moderate income levels. 3. Support moderate driver fees to improve transit without excessive burden. 4. Prefer lower transit fares to help transit-dependent residents. 5. Consider travel time improvements for both modes since community uses both. Selected policies optimize these factors while maintaining reasonable costs"
