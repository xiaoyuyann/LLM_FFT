    "disposable_income": "Avondale has a median household income of approximately $57,000, which is slightly below Chicago's median. About 15% of residents live below poverty level, suggesting moderate financial constraints for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets significantly. Many residents need to balance essential expenses with transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Avondale has good access to CTA Blue Line and multiple bus routes. About 32% of residents use public transit for commuting, while 55% drive. The area has a mix of transit-dependent and car-dependent households",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending power. 2. Balance moderate transit fares ($1.25) with service quality given mixed transit/driving usage. 3. Support modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4. Consider travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transportation needs. 5. Favor proposals that reduce transit travel times below 55 minutes while keeping driving times reasonable"
