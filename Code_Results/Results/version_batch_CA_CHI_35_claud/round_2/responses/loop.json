    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power, with high levels of retail, dining, and entertainment spending. The impact of sales tax increases would be noticeable but manageable given the income levels",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent transit accessibility with multiple L lines, Metra stations, and bus routes. It also has high walkability scores. While many residents own cars, transit is a viable and widely-used option. Traffic congestion is a major concern during peak hours",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, can prioritize time savings over cost savings. 2. Heavy transit infrastructure suggests policies supporting transit use are beneficial. 3. Congestion reduction through driver fees would significantly benefit the area. 4. Higher tax rates acceptable given income levels if they improve service. 5. Prefer balanced approaches that improve both transit and driving times. Selected policies that maximize travel time improvements while maintaining reasonable fare structures"
