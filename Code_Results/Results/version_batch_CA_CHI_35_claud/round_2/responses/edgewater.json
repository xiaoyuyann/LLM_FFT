    "disposable_income": "Edgewater has a median household income of around $54,000, slightly below Chicago's median. About 16% of residents live below poverty level. The community has a mix of middle-income and lower-income households, making cost sensitivity important.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would impact local businesses and residents' purchasing power. Many residents need to balance transportation costs with other essential expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by CTA Red Line and multiple bus routes. About 35% of residents use public transit for commuting, 35% drive, and others walk or bike. High transit accessibility with multiple options available. Dense, walkable neighborhood with good access to local amenities.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to high transit usage and moderate income levels. 2. Moderate sales tax (1%) balances revenue needs with economic impact. 3. Support driving fees to improve transit service and reduce congestion. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit large transit-dependent population. 5. Consider combined impact of fees on household budgets. Selected proposals balance improved transit service with reasonable costs."
