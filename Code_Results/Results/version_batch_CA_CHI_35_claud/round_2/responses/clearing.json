    "disposable_income": "Clearing is a middle-class community with median household income around $65,000. Many residents work in transportation and logistics sectors due to proximity to Midway Airport. The area has moderate disposable income levels, making residents somewhat sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. The community has a mix of homeowners and renters, with significant spending on transportation due to high car ownership rates and commuting needs",
    "accessibility": "The area is car-dependent with moderate transit access. Orange Line serves the northern edge, but many parts rely on buses. High car ownership rates (80%+ households) reflect auto-oriented development. Many residents drive to work, shopping, and services",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance driving efficiency with moderate costs given high car dependency\n2. Consider moderate transit improvements without excessive tax burden\n3. Support policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) due to moderate income levels\n4. Favor modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve traffic flow while avoiding severe cost impact\n5. Select options that maintain reasonable transit fares for those who depend on it"
