    "disposable_income": "Middle-income neighborhood with median household income around $65,000. Many working families with moderate disposable income. About 10% poverty rate indicates some economic constraints",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Moderate discretionary spending capacity. Residents are price-sensitive but can afford some additional transportation costs. Many households have significant retail spending in local commercial districts",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transit access - served by Blue Line and multiple bus routes but not as extensive as downtown areas. High car ownership rates (80%+ households). Many residents commute by both car and transit. Good road network with access to expressways",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced options that don't overly burden either drivers or transit users given mixed-mode usage. 2. Moderate tax rates preferred due to middle-income status. 3. Look for proposals that improve transit service without excessive costs. 4. Consider proposals that reduce driving times given high car usage. 5. Selected proposal 13 first as it offers good balance of moderate costs and improved travel times. 6. Ranked 10 second for low transit fare but improved service. 7. Chose 4 third as low tax option with reasonable improvements. 8. Added 22 fourth as it provides good service improvements. 9. Selected 16 fifth for balanced approach with moderate costs"
