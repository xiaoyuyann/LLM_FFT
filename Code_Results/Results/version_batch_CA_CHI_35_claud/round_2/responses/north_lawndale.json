    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has a median household income of approximately $25,000, significantly below Chicago's average. About 43% of residents live below poverty level, indicating very limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Most income goes to essential needs like housing, food, and utilities. Higher taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with Pink Line stations and bus routes. About 41% of households don't own vehicles and rely on public transit. Average commute times are higher than city average, particularly for transit users",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fare + tax) to preserve disposable income. 2. Need good transit service due to high transit dependency. 3. Lower fares more important than lower sales tax since fares affect daily costs. 4. Some driving fee acceptable to improve transit service. 5. Selected policies that balance improved transit times without excessive cost burden. Ranked proposals prioritizing $0.75 fares with moderate taxes and driving fees to fund service improvements while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents"
