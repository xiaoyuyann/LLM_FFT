    "disposable_income": "Humboldt Park has a median household income of approximately $36,000, significantly below Chicago's median. About 28% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a large portion of income on basic necessities, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs and sales taxes",
    "accessibility": "About 35% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. The area has several bus routes and is served by the Blue Line, though not directly through the neighborhood. Many residents combine transit modes for commuting",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Moderate sales tax to balance transit funding with impact on household budgets. 3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent households. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve access to jobs and services. 5. Consider overall cost burden of combined policies on low-income residents"
