    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is an affluent area with median household income around $106,000, well above Chicago average. Residents have relatively high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Most households own cars and have significant retail expenditure. Higher sales tax would impact but not severely constrain spending",
    "accessibility": "Primarily car-dependent suburban-style area with lower transit access compared to city core. Most residents drive, with 85%+ car ownership. Limited bus service and distance from L trains makes transit less convenient. Good road network access",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency and income levels, policies that improve driving times without excessive fees are preferred. 2. Higher sales tax is acceptable given income levels if it improves overall service. 3. Transit improvements still valuable as secondary option and for equity. 4. Moderate driving fees acceptable to reduce congestion. 5. Very high transit fares less important given lower transit usage. Selected policies balance driving time improvements with moderate cost increases that community can afford"
