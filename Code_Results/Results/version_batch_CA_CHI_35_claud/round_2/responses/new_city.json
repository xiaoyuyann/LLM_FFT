    "disposable_income": "New City has a relatively low median household income around $33,000, with about 35% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary spending is very limited. Residents likely spend most income on necessities. Higher taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with bus routes and proximity to Orange Line. About 30% of households don't own vehicles and rely on public transit. Average commute times are higher than city median.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fares+tax+fees). 2. Need balance of transit improvement without excessive cost burden. 3. Many transit-dependent residents need reliable service. 4. Lower transit fares more important than driving fees given demographics. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit times while keeping fares affordable and taxes moderate. Ranked based on combination of improved transit service and cost sensitivity."
