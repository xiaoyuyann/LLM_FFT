    "disposable_income": "Roseland has a median household income of approximately $37,000, significantly below Chicago's average. About 24% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a large portion of income on essential needs, making them sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Roseland is served by Metra Electric District line and several CTA bus routes, but transit service is less frequent compared to North Side communities. About 75% of households own cars, though many are car-dependent due to limited transit options. Average commute times are longer than city average",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) due to community's limited income and reliance on public transit. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on household budgets. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Balance between improved transit times and affordability. 5. Consider proposals that reduce both transit and driving times while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents"
