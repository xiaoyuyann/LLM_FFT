    "disposable_income": "Pullman has a median household income of approximately $41,000, which is below Chicago's median. Many residents have limited disposable income, making them sensitive to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. The community has significant retail gaps, requiring travel for many purchases. Higher sales taxes would impact already constrained budgets",
    "accessibility": "Pullman is served by Metra Electric District line and several CTA bus routes. Many residents rely on public transit, but service frequency and coverage could be improved. Car ownership rates are lower than city average, making transit accessibility crucial",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to income constraints and high transit dependency. 2. Moderate sales tax to balance transit funding needs with household budgets. 3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent trips. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility. 5. Consider combined impact of all fees/taxes on limited household budgets"
