    "disposable_income": "Brighton Park is a working-class community with median household income around $43,000, significantly below Chicago's median. Many residents work in manufacturing and service sectors, with about 18% of families below poverty level",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels. Residents are price-sensitive to both transit fares and sales taxes. Many households spend significant portion of income on basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "Good bus service along major arterials, access to Orange Line at Western and Kedzie stations. About 30% of households don't own cars. Many residents rely on public transit for work commutes to downtown and other areas",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares and moderate tax rates given limited disposable income. 2. Consider policies that improve transit service while keeping costs affordable for transit-dependent residents. 3. Support some driving fees to fund transit but avoid highest fees due to working families who need cars. 4. Balance between transit service improvements and cost burden on low-income residents. 5. Selected policies that reduce transit travel times while maintaining affordability"
