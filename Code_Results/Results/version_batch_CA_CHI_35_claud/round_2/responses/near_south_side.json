Many residents own cars and regularly drive due to good highway access. The area is close to downtown and major employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance transit improvements with moderate costs given high income levels\n2. Support some driving fees to reduce congestion while maintaining reasonable car access\n3. Accept moderate sales tax increases to fund transit given strong income levels\n4. Favor policies that reduce transit travel times to benefit both commuters and visitors\n5. Consider mixed-mode transportation needs of residents who use both transit and cars regularly"
