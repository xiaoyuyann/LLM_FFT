    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Park is one of Chicago's most affluent neighborhoods with median household income over $115,000. Residents have high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending on retail, dining, and entertainment. The community has significant retail corridors and residents tend to make frequent trips for shopping and leisure activities",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by public transit with multiple L stations (Red/Brown/Purple lines) and bus routes. High car ownership rates but also high transit usage. Dense, walkable neighborhood with many destinations accessible by multiple modes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, can tolerate higher fees/taxes to fund better service. 2. Mixed-mode transportation patterns suggest balancing car and transit improvements. 3. Dense retail/commercial activity means frequent trips - travel time savings valuable. 4. Higher driver fees acceptable to reduce congestion in dense area. 5. Prefer options that significantly improve transit times while maintaining reasonable driving access. Selected proposals that combine moderate-to-high driver fees with moderate transit fares to optimize both modes"
