    "disposable_income": "Washington Park is one of Chicago's lowest-income communities with median household income around $25,000. Many residents live below poverty line and have very limited disposable income. High unemployment rate (~40%) further constrains household budgets.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Most income goes to basic necessities like housing, food, and utilities. Even small increases in transportation costs or taxes would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to CTA Green Line and bus routes. Car ownership rates are low (~40% of households). Many residents rely heavily on public transit for work, shopping, and accessing services. Travel times by transit are important for job accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability\n2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending\n3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to fund transit while improving service\n4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve job accessibility\n5. Balance between transit affordability and service quality improvements"
