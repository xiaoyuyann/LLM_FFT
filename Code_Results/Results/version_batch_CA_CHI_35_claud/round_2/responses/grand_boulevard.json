    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a lower median household income around $27,000, with about 39% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary spending is very limited. Residents need to prioritize essential expenses like housing, food, and transportation. Higher taxes or fees would significantly impact already constrained budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to CTA bus and rail services, with about 45% of residents using public transit for commuting. Car ownership is lower than city average at around 50% of households. Many residents are transit-dependent.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fare + tax) while maintaining service quality. 2. Focus on transit improvements since many residents rely on public transit. 3. Lower transit fares are more important than driving fees since car ownership is lower. 4. Moderate tax rates to balance revenue needs with resident affordability. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents."
