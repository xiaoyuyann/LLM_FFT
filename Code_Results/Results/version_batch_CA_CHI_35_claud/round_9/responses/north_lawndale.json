    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $25,000, with 43% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates very limited disposable income for transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high poverty rate and low income, discretionary spending is severely limited. Residents are highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees that would reduce their already constrained budgets",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with Pink Line stations and bus routes, but 30% of households don't own vehicles. Many residents rely on public transit for essential trips to work, shopping, and services. Average commute times are higher than city average",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given very low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fare + tax + fees). 2. Need reliable transit service given high transit dependency. 3. Favor proposals with low transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability. 4. Moderate sales tax (1%) acceptable if it improves service. 5. Avoid highest driving fees since they burden low-income car owners. Selected proposals balance service improvements with cost sensitivity"
