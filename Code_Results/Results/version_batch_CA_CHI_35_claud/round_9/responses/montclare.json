    "disposable_income": "Montclare has a median household income of around $54,000, which is slightly below Chicago's median. Many residents are working-class families with moderate disposable income. About 12% of residents live below poverty level, making them sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets significantly. Many families need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "Montclare is a somewhat car-dependent neighborhood on Chicago's northwest side. While served by CTA buses, it lacks direct rail service. About 75% of residents drive to work, while 20% use public transit. The community has above-average car ownership rates",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency but moderate incomes, prefer policies with lower driving fees and moderate transit improvements. 2. Lower sales tax (0.5%) preferred due to impact on household budgets. 3. Moderate transit fares ($1.25) balance revenue needs with affordability. 4. Policies 4, 3, 1, 0, and 9 selected as they minimize total cost burden while providing reasonable travel times for both modes. 5. Policy 4 ranked first as it offers good balance of driving/transit times with moderate fees"
