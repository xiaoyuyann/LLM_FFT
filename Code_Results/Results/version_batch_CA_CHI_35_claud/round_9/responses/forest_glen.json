    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is an affluent area with median household income around $106,000, well above Chicago average. Residents have relatively high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Most households own cars and have significant retail spending. Higher sales tax would have moderate but manageable impact on consumption",
    "accessibility": "Primarily car-dependent suburban-style neighborhood with lower transit access compared to city core. Has Metra station but limited CTA bus service. Over 90% of households own cars and most commute by driving",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency and income levels, policies that improve driving times without excessive fees are preferred. 2. Moderate tax increases acceptable if they improve overall transportation system. 3. Higher transit fares less concerning due to limited transit usage and higher incomes. 4. Focus on reducing congestion through balanced approach. 5. Selected policies that maintain reasonable driving costs while funding system improvements through modest tax increases. Ranked proposals balancing these factors, with preference for moderate rather than extreme policy changes"
