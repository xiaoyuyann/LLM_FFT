    "disposable_income": "Chatham has a median household income of approximately $34,962, significantly lower than Chicago's median. About 23% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households need to carefully budget for essential needs, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes",
    "accessibility": "Chatham has good access to public transit with Red Line stations and multiple bus routes. About 33% of households don't own vehicles and rely on public transit. The community has a high proportion of transit-dependent residents",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and taxes to preserve disposable income. 2. High transit dependency means better transit service is crucial. 3. Lower driving fees preferred as many working residents need cars for employment. 4. Balance between service improvement and cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs manageable. Ranked proposals that combine moderate taxes with lower fares higher, as they benefit transit-dependent residents while not overly burdening drivers"
