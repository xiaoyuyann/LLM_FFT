    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a lower median household income around $30,000, with about 39% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Many residents rely on essential purchases and are price-sensitive to both sales tax increases and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with multiple bus routes and Green Line stations. About 42% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. The community has a high transit dependency rate.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fare + tax) while maintaining service quality. 2. Many residents are transit-dependent, so transit travel time improvements are crucial. 3. Lower transit fares are more important than driving fees since many don't own cars. 4. Moderate tax rates can help improve service without overly burdening residents. 5. Selected proposals balance improved transit service with affordability. Ranked proposals progressively trade off slightly higher costs for better service."
