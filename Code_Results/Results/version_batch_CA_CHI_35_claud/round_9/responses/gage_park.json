    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class community with median household income around $41,000, significantly below Chicago's average. Many residents work in service and manufacturing sectors, with about 18% of families below poverty level",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to low income levels. Residents are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees. Many households spend significant portion of income on basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "High transit dependency with about 20% of households without vehicles. CTA bus routes and Orange Line provide essential connectivity. Many residents rely on public transit for work commutes. Mixed-use development pattern supports both transit and driving needs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares ($0.75) due to high transit dependency and low income levels. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) acceptable to improve transit service without excessive burden on driving households. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden crucial for mixed-mode community. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs affordable"
