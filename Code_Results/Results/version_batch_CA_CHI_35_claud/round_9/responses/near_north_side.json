    "disposable_income": "Near North Side has one of the highest median household incomes in Chicago (over $100,000). Residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending, with numerous luxury retail, dining, and entertainment venues. Residents typically spend more on goods/services, so sales tax impact is notable but manageable",
    "accessibility": "Excellent transit access with multiple L lines, bus routes, and walkable streets. High car ownership but also heavy transit usage. Major employment/entertainment center with significant traffic congestion",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, can tolerate higher fees/taxes to improve service. 2. Heavy congestion means driving time improvements are valuable. 3. Mixed transit/driving usage means balanced approach needed. 4. Dense urban area benefits from transit improvements. 5. Higher driver fees acceptable to reduce congestion. Prefer options with moderate-high driver fees, moderate transit fares, and moderate taxes that significantly improve both transit and driving times"
