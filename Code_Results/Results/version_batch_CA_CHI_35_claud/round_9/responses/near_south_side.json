    "disposable_income": "Near South Side has relatively high median household income around $83,000. Many residents are professionals and higher-income workers with significant disposable income. The area has seen substantial development of luxury condos and apartments.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have high discretionary spending capacity and frequently use both transit and cars. The area has many retail establishments, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Higher sales taxes would impact discretionary spending but most residents can absorb the cost.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit access with multiple L lines (Red, Green, Orange), bus routes, and Metra stations. It's also very walkable and bikeable. Many residents commute to the Loop. While car ownership is high, many households are car-optional due to good transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that improve both transit and driving times since residents use both modes frequently. 2. Higher-income residents can absorb moderate fare/fee increases if they deliver better service. 3. Moderate tax rates (1%) balance revenue needs with impact on local businesses. 4. Driving fees help fund transit while managing congestion in this dense area. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times below 52 minutes while keeping driving times under 19 minutes."
