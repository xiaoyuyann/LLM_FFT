Policy 9 ranked first as it offers low transit fare while maintaining decent service. 5. Policy 0 second as it minimizes tax burden. 6. Policy 3 third as it balances fare and service. 7. Policy 10 fourth as it improves transit time with moderate costs. 8. Policy 1 fifth as it offers low fare with reasonable transit time"
