    "disposable_income": "Calumet Heights has a median household income of around $48,000, which is moderate for Chicago. The community has a significant middle-class population with many homeowners, but also contains households with more limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. Many households need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. The community has a relatively high rate of car ownership, suggesting significant transportation spending",
    "accessibility": "The area is served by the Metra Electric District line and several bus routes, but transit service is less frequent than in areas closer to downtown. Many residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting and daily errands. The community is somewhat distant from major employment centers",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance transit improvement with moderate costs, given mixed-income population. 2. Consider policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to preserve discretionary spending power. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Favor proposals that significantly improve transit times while keeping fares affordable. 5. Selected policies that reduce car travel times to benefit car-owning residents while improving transit service"
