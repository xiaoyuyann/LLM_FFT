    "disposable_income": "Irving Park has a median household income of approximately $71,000, which is above Chicago's median. About 10% of residents live below poverty level. The community has a mix of middle-class and working-class households with moderate disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. The area has a significant number of homeowners with mortgage obligations. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets but not severely given the income levels.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with Blue Line, Metra UP-NW, and multiple bus routes. Car ownership is high at about 80% of households. Mixed-use development along commercial corridors means many amenities are accessible by both transit and car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that maintain transit service while not overly burdening drivers given high car ownership\n2. Moderate fare/fee increases acceptable given income levels to improve service\n3. Prefer 1% tax over 1.5% to limit impact on discretionary spending\n4. Value reduced transit travel times to benefit transit-dependent residents\n5. Consider policies that reduce congestion given heavy traffic on arterials"
