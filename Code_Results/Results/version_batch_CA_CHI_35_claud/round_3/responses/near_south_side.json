    "disposable_income": "Near South Side has relatively high median household income around $83,000. Many residents are professionals and higher-income workers with significant disposable income. The area has seen substantial development and gentrification in recent years.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have above-average discretionary spending capacity. The area features many retail establishments, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Higher sales taxes would have a moderate but not severe impact on consumption patterns.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit access with multiple L lines (Red, Green, Orange), bus routes, and Metra stations. Also well-connected by roads/highways. Many residents use both transit and cars. Walking/biking infrastructure is good. Mixed-use development supports multi-modal transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that improve both transit and driving times without excessive costs, given the mixed-mode usage in the area. 2. Higher income means some tolerance for moderate fees/taxes to fund improvements. 3. Strong transit infrastructure means transit improvements will be well-utilized. 4. Select policies that reduce congestion given dense urban location. 5. Consider proposals with moderate rather than highest taxes given good existing service levels. Selected proposals 14, 23, 5, 13, and 11 as they offer significant travel time improvements for both modes while keeping costs reasonable."
