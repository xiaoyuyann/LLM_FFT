    "disposable_income": "Middle-income neighborhood with median household income around $65,000. Many working families with moderate disposable income. About 10% poverty rate indicates some economic constraints",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Moderate discretionary spending capacity. Residents are price-sensitive but can afford some additional transportation costs. Many households have significant retail spending in local commercial districts",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transit access - served by Blue Line and multiple bus routes but not as extensive as downtown areas. High car ownership rates (80%+ households). Many residents commute by both car and transit. Good road network with access to expressways",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced options that don't overly burden either drivers or transit users given mixed transportation needs. 2. Moderate tax rates preferred due to middle-income status. 3. Support some driving fees to improve transit but avoid highest fees. 4. Lower transit fares beneficial for transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality. 5. Consider time savings benefits against cost increases. Selected proposals balance these factors while keeping overall costs manageable for typical household budgets"
