    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn is a lower-middle income community with median household income around $37,000. Many residents face economic constraints, making them sensitive to transportation costs and tax increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels. Residents typically spend significant portion of income on essential needs, making them vulnerable to increased taxes and fees",
    "accessibility": "Good transit access with multiple bus routes and proximity to Orange Line. Car ownership rate is moderate but many households rely on public transit. Mixed-use development pattern makes both driving and transit viable options",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to community's income constraints and reliance on public transit. 2. Moderate tax rates to balance service improvements with household budget impacts. 3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility. 5. Consider balance between car and transit improvements given mixed transportation needs"
