    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Park is one of Chicago's most affluent neighborhoods with median household income over $115,000. Residents have high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending on retail, dining, and entertainment. The community has significant retail corridors and residents tend to make frequent trips for shopping and leisure activities",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by public transit with multiple L stations (Red/Brown/Purple lines) and bus routes. High car ownership rates but also high transit usage. Dense, walkable neighborhood with many destinations accessible by multiple modes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, can tolerate higher fees/taxes to fund better service. 2. Many residents use both cars and transit, so balanced improvements to both modes are valuable. 3. Higher driver fees acceptable as they reduce congestion in dense area. 4. Prefer options that significantly improve transit times without extreme fare increases. 5. Selected proposals that balance service improvements with moderate cost increases across modes. Ranked based on overall time savings and reasonable cost structure"
