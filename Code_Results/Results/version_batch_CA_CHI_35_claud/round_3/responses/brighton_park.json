    "disposable_income": "Brighton Park is a working-class community with median household income around $43,000, significantly below Chicago's median. About 23% of families live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would have a significant impact on household budgets. Many families need to carefully budget for basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "The community has moderate transit access with CTA Orange Line and several bus routes. About 70% of residents commute by car, while 23% use public transit. Many residents are transit-dependent due to economic constraints",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents\n2. Favor lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) due to limited discretionary income\n3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without excessive burden\n4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts\n5. Consider proposals that benefit both transit users and drivers through reduced congestion"
