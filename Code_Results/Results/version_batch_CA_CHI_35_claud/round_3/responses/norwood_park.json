    "disposable_income": "Norwood Park is an upper-middle-class area with median household income around $82,000. Residents have relatively high disposable income compared to Chicago average, making them less sensitive to moderate fare/fee increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Many households own cars and can afford higher transportation costs. Sales tax impact on $20,000 annual discretionary spending would be $100-300 depending on rate",
    "accessibility": "Located on far northwest side with good access to Blue Line and Metra. High car ownership (85%+ households). Most residents drive but have transit options. Average commute time is 35-40 minutes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. As an affluent car-dependent area, policies balancing driver fees with improved transit make sense\n2. Higher driver fees acceptable if they reduce congestion\n3. Moderate transit fares preferred over lowest fares to maintain service quality\n4. Mid-range sales tax (1%) provides funding without excessive burden\n5. Focus on options that reduce both car and transit travel times\n6. Selected policies 14, 5, 13, 4, and 11 as they optimize travel times while keeping costs reasonable for area's income level"
