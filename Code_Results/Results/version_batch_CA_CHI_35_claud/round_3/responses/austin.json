    "disposable_income": "Austin has a median household income of approximately $33,000, significantly below Chicago's average. About 30% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households struggle with basic necessities, making them highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees",
    "accessibility": "Austin has good access to public transit with Green Line L and multiple bus routes. However, about 65% of residents rely on personal vehicles. The community faces longer than average commute times, with many residents traveling to jobs outside the area",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and taxes to maintain affordability. 2. Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Balance between travel time improvements and cost burden. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time to benefit transit-dependent residents. 5. Selected proposals 0, 9, 3, 10, and 1 as they offer the best combination of low fares/taxes while still providing service improvements"
