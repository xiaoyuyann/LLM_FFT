    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is an affluent area with median household income around $106,000, well above Chicago average. Residents have relatively high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Most households own cars and have significant retail spending. Higher sales tax would have moderate but manageable impact on consumption",
    "accessibility": "Primarily car-dependent suburban-style neighborhood with lower transit access compared to city average. Has Metra station but limited bus service. Over 90% of households own cars and most commute by driving",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency and income levels, policies that improve driving times without excessive fees are preferred\n2. Moderate tax increases acceptable if they improve overall transportation\n3. Higher transit fares less concerning since most residents drive\n4. Focus on reducing congestion through balanced driver fees\n5. Ranked proposals that maintain reasonable driving costs while improving travel times\n6. Selected options with 1-1.5% tax range as community can absorb the cost\n7. Prioritized proposals that reduce car travel times below 19 minutes"
