    "disposable_income": "Ashburn has a median household income of around $65,000, which is slightly above Chicago's median. However, with significant homeownership costs and family expenses, residents are cost-sensitive to transportation expenses",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Moderate discretionary spending capacity, with many working-class and middle-class families. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets, especially for larger families common in this area",
    "accessibility": "Heavily car-dependent community with limited public transit options. Most residents rely on personal vehicles, though some use Metra Rock Island line at the edge of the neighborhood. Long commute times to downtown and other employment centers",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that minimize impact on car users given high car dependency\n2. Keep sales tax moderate due to family budgets\n3. Prefer lower transit fares to make it more attractive as alternative\n4. Balance driving fees to improve transit without overly burdening drivers\n5. Selected policies that reduce overall travel times while maintaining affordability"
