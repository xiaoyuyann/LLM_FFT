    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has a median household income of approximately $37,000, significantly below Chicago's median. About 27% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income and high poverty rate, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a significant portion of income on essential needs, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes",
    "accessibility": "The area is served by Metra Electric District line and CTA buses, but transit coverage is limited. About 70% of residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting. The community is relatively far from major employment centers, resulting in longer commute times",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) due to limited household incomes and high poverty rate. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases. 3. Consider moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that offer best combination of lower costs and improved transit service for both transit users and drivers"
