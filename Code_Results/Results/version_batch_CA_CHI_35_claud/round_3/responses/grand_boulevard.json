    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a lower median household income around $27,916, with about 39% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income for transportation costs and sensitivity to fare/fee increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets. Many residents rely on SNAP benefits and other assistance programs, suggesting minimal flexible spending.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with Green and Red Line stations and multiple bus routes. About 42% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. The community has a transit dependency rate above city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability. 2. Moderate sales tax (1%) balances revenue needs with impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Support driving fees to improve transit service while most residents use transit. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times given high transit dependency. 5. Consider proposals that maintain reasonable driving costs for car-owning households while improving overall service."
