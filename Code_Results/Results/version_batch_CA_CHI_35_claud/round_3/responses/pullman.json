    "disposable_income": "Pullman has a median household income of approximately $41,000, which is below Chicago's average. Many residents have limited disposable income and are sensitive to transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets. Many families need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "Pullman is served by Metra Electric District line and several CTA bus routes. However, many residents rely on cars due to longer transit travel times to reach jobs and services. The area has moderate transit accessibility but improvements are needed",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 2. Favor moderate transit fares ($1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality. 3. Support modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel times to increase accessibility for transit-dependent residents"
