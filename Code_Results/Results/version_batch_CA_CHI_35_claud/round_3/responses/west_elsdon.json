    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon is a working-class community with median household income around $51,000, lower than Chicago's average. Many residents work in service and industrial jobs, making them sensitive to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to moderate income levels. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets. Many families need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "Located on southwest side with moderate transit access via Orange Line and buses. High car dependency with 85% of households owning vehicles. Average commute times are significant factor. Many residents drive to work in other parts of city and suburbs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect limited discretionary income. 2. Balance moderate transit fares ($1.25) to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable. 3. Support modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Focus on options that reduce both transit and driving times. 5. Consider proposals that maintain reasonable costs for both modes given mixed transit-driving usage patterns"
