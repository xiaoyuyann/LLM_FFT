    "accessibility": "Well-served by CTA Blue Line, multiple bus routes, bike lanes, and major arterial roads. Mixed-use development pattern with good walkability. Many residents use multiple transportation modes regularly",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that improve both transit and driving times without excessive costs given mixed-mode usage. 2. Higher income means moderate fees/taxes are acceptable if they improve service. 3. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to support sustainable transportation. 4. Consider proposals with moderate driver fees to manage congestion while maintaining accessibility. 5. Select options that maintain reasonable transit fares to encourage ridership while generating revenue for improvements"
