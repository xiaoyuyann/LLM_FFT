    "disposable_income": "Near North Side has one of the highest median household incomes in Chicago (over $100,000). Residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending, with numerous luxury retail, dining, and entertainment venues. Residents typically spend more on goods/services, so sales tax impact is notable but manageable",
    "accessibility": "Excellent transit access with multiple L lines, bus routes, and walkable streets. High car ownership but also heavy transit usage. Major employment/entertainment center with significant traffic congestion",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, can tolerate higher fees/taxes to improve service. 2. Heavy congestion means driving fees could help traffic flow. 3. Strong transit infrastructure means improvements will be widely utilized. 4. Dense urban area benefits from reduced car dependency. 5. Ranked proposals that balance service improvements with moderate cost increases, prioritizing reduced transit times and congestion relief through driving fees. 6. Higher tax rates acceptable given income levels and benefits of improved transit. 7. Selected options that maintain reasonable transit fares to encourage ridership while using driving fees to manage congestion"
