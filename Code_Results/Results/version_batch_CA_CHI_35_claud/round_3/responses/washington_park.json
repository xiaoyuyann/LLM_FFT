    "disposable_income": "Washington Park is one of Chicago's lowest-income communities with median household income around $25,000. Many residents live below poverty line and have very limited disposable income. High unemployment rate (~40%) further constrains household budgets.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Most income goes to basic necessities. Even small increases in transportation costs or taxes would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to CTA Green Line and bus routes. Car ownership rates are low due to economic constraints. Many residents rely heavily on public transit for work, shopping, and accessing services. Travel times by transit are important for job accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fares+taxes+fees). 2. Strong transit dependency means better transit service times are crucial. 3. Lower transit fares are more important than driving fees since most residents use transit. 4. Moderate sales tax can help fund transit improvements while not overly burdening low-income residents. 5. Selected policies balance minimal costs with improved transit times."
