    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a median household income of around $54,000, slightly below Chicago's median. About 19% of residents live below poverty level. The community has a significant immigrant population with varying income levels",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels and high cost of living in Chicago, residents have limited discretionary spending. Many households need to carefully budget for transportation costs alongside other essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes and proximity to Red Line stations. Car ownership is relatively high at about 75% of households. Many residents commute to work using both public transit and private vehicles. The community has a mix of transit-dependent and car-dependent residents",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to preserve discretionary income for mixed-income population. 2. Balance moderate transit fares ($1.25) with service improvements to help transit-dependent residents. 3. Support modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit commuters. 5. Consider proposals that maintain reasonable driving costs for car-dependent households. Selected proposals 4, 13, 10, 1, and 3 as they best balance these factors for West Ridge's mixed transportation needs"
