    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a relatively low median household income around $36,000, with about 28% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. The community has high cost burden for basic necessities, making additional taxes and fees particularly impactful on household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to public transit with multiple bus routes and Pink Line stations. About 30% of households don't own vehicles and rely on public transit. Many residents are transit-dependent for accessing jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares ($0.75) given high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without excessive burden. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Consider proposals that maintain transit affordability while providing service improvements."
