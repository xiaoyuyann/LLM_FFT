    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $25,000, with 43% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates very limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Most income goes to essential needs, making them highly sensitive to any additional transportation costs or taxes",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with Pink Line stations and bus routes, but 40% of households don't own vehicles. Many residents are transit-dependent. Average commute times are higher than city average, indicating transportation challenges",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given very low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fares+taxes+fees). 2. Need good transit service since many residents are transit-dependent. 3. Lower transit fares are critical for affordability. 4. Moderate sales tax preferred as very high taxes would burden essential purchases. 5. Some driving fees acceptable to improve transit but kept moderate due to needed car access for some residents. Selected policies balance improved transit service while minimizing cost burden on low-income residents"
