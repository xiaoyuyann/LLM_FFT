    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a median household income of approximately $57,000, which is moderate for Chicago. About 15% of residents live below poverty level, indicating a significant portion of the population needs to be mindful of transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending power. The community has a mix of middle-class and working-class households, with significant portions of income going to housing and essential needs. Higher taxes or fees would impact household budgets notably",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park is served by Metra Rock Island Line but has limited CTA rail access. Many residents rely on cars for commuting. The area has moderate bus service coverage. The community is relatively far from downtown, making travel times and costs particularly important",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to moderate income levels and distance from downtown. 2. Moderate tax rates to balance service improvements with household budget impacts. 3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times given the area's distance from key destinations. 5. Consider proposals that balance both driving and transit improvements since many residents use both modes"
