    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $25,000, with 43% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates very limited disposable income for transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high poverty rate and low income, discretionary spending is severely limited. Residents are highly sensitive to any additional costs from taxes, fares, or fees as they significantly impact their ability to afford basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with Pink Line stations and bus routes, but 30% of households don't own vehicles. Many residents rely on public transit for accessing jobs and services. Current transit travel times are long compared to driving",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given very low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (low tax, low fare, no/low driving fee). 2. Need to maintain reasonable transit service given high transit dependency. 3. Moderate tax rate can help fund transit improvements. 4. Avoid high driving fees as many working residents need cars to access jobs. 5. Balance between travel time improvements and affordability. Selected proposals that minimize costs while maintaining adequate transit service levels"
