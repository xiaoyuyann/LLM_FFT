    "disposable_income": "West Town has a relatively high median household income around $95,000, with many young professionals and families. Residents have moderate to high disposable income and can generally afford transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Area has high discretionary spending capacity, with numerous restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues. Residents frequently make discretionary trips for dining, shopping, and recreation",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by CTA Blue Line, multiple bus routes, bike lanes, and major arterial roads. Mixed-use development with good walkability. Many residents use multiple transportation modes regularly",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that improve both transit and driving times without excessive costs, given mixed-mode usage. 2. Higher income means moderate fare/fee increases are acceptable if they improve service. 3. Lower sales tax preferred due to high discretionary spending. 4. Value proposals that reduce transit travel times since many residents use public transit. 5. Consider policies that manage congestion through moderate driving fees since many residents also drive"
