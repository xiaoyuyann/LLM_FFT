    "disposable_income": "Clearing is a middle-class community with median household income around $65,000. Many residents work in transportation and logistics sectors due to proximity to Midway Airport. Moderate disposable income suggests sensitivity to both transit fares and driving costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. The 1-1.5% sales tax increase would impact household budgets but not severely. Many households own cars and regularly drive, making driving fees a notable consideration",
    "accessibility": "Located on southwest side with good road access but limited transit options. Many residents rely on cars for commuting. The Orange Line serves the northern edge but much of area requires bus connections. Driving is prevalent due to airport proximity and industrial employment centers",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance driving efficiency with moderate fees since many residents drive\n2. Favor lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) due to moderate income levels\n3. Accept moderate transit fares ($1.25) as many use park-and-ride\n4. Consider policies that improve both driving and transit times\n5. Selected proposals that minimize total cost burden while maintaining service quality"
