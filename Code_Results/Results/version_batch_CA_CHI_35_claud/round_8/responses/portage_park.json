    "disposable_income": "Middle-income neighborhood with median household income around $65,000. Many working families with moderate disposable income. About 10% poverty rate indicates some economic constraints",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Moderate discretionary spending capacity. Residents are price-sensitive but can afford some additional transportation costs. Many households have significant retail spending in local commercial districts",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transit access - served by Blue Line and multiple bus routes but not as extensive as downtown areas. High car ownership rates (80%+ households). Many residents commute by both car and transit. Good road network with access to expressways",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced options that don't overly burden either drivers or transit users given mixed transportation needs. 2. Moderate tax rates preferred due to middle-income status. 3. Look for proposals that improve transit service while keeping costs reasonable. 4. Consider proposals that reduce congestion given high car usage. 5. Selected proposals 10, 13, 4, 19, and 22 as they offer: a) Modest tax increases (0.5-1.5%), b) Reasonable transit fares ($0.75-1.25), c) Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to manage congestion, d) Good improvements in both transit and driving times"
