    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon is a working-class community with median household income around $51,000, lower than Chicago's average. Many residents work in service and industrial jobs, making them sensitive to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to moderate income levels. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets. Many families need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "High car dependency with about 85% of households owning vehicles. Limited direct transit access with only bus services. Many residents commute to jobs in other parts of the city. The Orange Line is not within walking distance for most residents",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and limited transit access, policies with lower driving fees are preferred. 2. Lower sales tax (0.5%) prioritized due to limited discretionary income. 3. Moderate transit fares ($1.25) balance system funding with affordability. 4. Policies that reduce driving times without excessive costs are valued. 5. Selected proposals balance travel time improvements with cost burden on working families"
