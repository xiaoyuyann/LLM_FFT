    "disposable_income": "South Deering has a median household income of approximately $31,200, which is significantly below Chicago's median. About 32% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a large portion of their income on basic necessities, making them particularly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees",
    "accessibility": "The area is relatively transit-poor with limited bus service and no L train stations. Many residents rely on cars for transportation due to the industrial nature of the area and distance from downtown. The area has a higher than average car ownership rate despite low incomes due to transit limitations",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize proposals with lower taxes and fees to preserve disposable income. 2. Since many residents drive out of necessity, avoid high driving fees. 3. Lower transit fares are preferred to make transit more accessible when possible. 4. Balance between maintaining reasonable car travel times and improving transit service. 5. Selected proposals 0, 3, 9, 12, and 21 as they offer combinations of lower taxes/fees while still providing acceptable service levels"
