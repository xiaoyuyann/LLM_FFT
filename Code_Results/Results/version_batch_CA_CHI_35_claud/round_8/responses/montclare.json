    "disposable_income": "Montclare has a median household income of around $54,000, which is slightly below Chicago's median. Many residents are working-class families with moderate disposable income. About 12% of residents live below poverty level, making them sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Most household budgets are allocated to essential needs. Higher taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "Montclare is a somewhat car-dependent neighborhood on Chicago's northwest side. While served by CTA buses, it lacks direct rail access. About 75% of residents drive to work, while 20% use public transit. The community has above-average car ownership rates",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency but moderate incomes, prefer policies with lower driving fees and moderate taxes to avoid overburdening drivers. 2. Transit improvements should be balanced against cost impact on working families. 3. Policy 3 ranks first as it maintains low tax with no driving fee while keeping transit affordable. 4. Policy 9 second as it improves transit with moderate tax increase. 5. Policy 0 third as it reduces transit costs. 6. Policy 12 fourth as current policy. 7. Policy 4 fifth as balanced approach with minimal impact on drivers"
