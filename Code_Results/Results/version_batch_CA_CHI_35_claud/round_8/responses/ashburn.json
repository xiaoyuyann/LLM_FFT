    "disposable_income": "Ashburn has a median household income of around $65,000, which is slightly above Chicago's median. However, with significant homeownership rates and family households, residents face substantial fixed expenses",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Moderate discretionary spending capacity, with many working-class and middle-class families. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets, especially for families with children",
    "accessibility": "Heavily car-dependent community with limited public transit options. Most residents rely on personal vehicles, though some use Metra SouthWest Service line. Distance from downtown makes commute times significant",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) due to impact on family budgets. 2. Favor moderate driving fees since most residents drive but need some incentive for transit improvement. 3. Support lower transit fares to encourage occasional transit use. 4. Balance between reducing car travel times and maintaining reasonable costs. 5. Selected policies that don't overly burden drivers while still improving transit service"
