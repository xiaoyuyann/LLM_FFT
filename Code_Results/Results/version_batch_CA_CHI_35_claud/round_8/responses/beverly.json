    "disposable_income": "Beverly is an upper-middle-class community with median household income around $94,000. Residents have relatively high disposable income compared to Chicago average, making them less sensitive to moderate fare/fee increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Many households can afford cars and have significant retail spending. Higher sales tax would impact discretionary purchases but not severely given income levels",
    "accessibility": "Beverly has Metra Rock Island line stations but limited CTA rail access. Many residents are car-dependent for commuting. Good road network with connection to major highways. Mixed transit-car usage with higher car ownership rates",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and usage, prefer policies with moderate driving fees to reduce congestion while maintaining reasonable car costs. 2. Higher sales tax is acceptable given disposable income levels if it improves transit. 3. Moderate transit fares preferred to maintain service quality while keeping transit competitive. 4. Focus on policies that balance car and transit improvements since residents use both. 5. Selected proposals that reduce travel times for both modes while keeping costs manageable for area's income levels"
