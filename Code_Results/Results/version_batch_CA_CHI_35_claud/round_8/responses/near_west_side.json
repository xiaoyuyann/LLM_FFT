    "disposable_income": "Near West Side has a mixed income profile with median household income around $71,000. The area includes both affluent professionals and lower-income residents. Major employers include the Illinois Medical District and University of Illinois Chicago.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Significant discretionary spending capacity exists among professional residents, but also contains many students and working-class households with more limited disposable income. The area has high retail and entertainment spending due to proximity to downtown.",
    "accessibility": "Excellent transit access with multiple CTA L lines (Blue, Green, Pink) and bus routes. High walkability and bikeability. Good road access but experiences heavy congestion. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting to downtown jobs and educational institutions.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that improve transit service while keeping fares moderate given the mixed-income population and high transit reliance\n2. Support moderate driving fees to reduce congestion while not overly burdening drivers\n3. Accept moderate sales tax to fund transit improvements given the area's overall economic capacity\n4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts across modes\n5. Consider policies that benefit both transit-dependent residents and choice riders"
