    "disposable_income": "Near South Side has relatively high median household income around $83,000. Many residents are professionals and higher-income workers with significant disposable income. The area has seen substantial development of luxury condos and apartments.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have high discretionary spending capacity and frequently use both transit and cars. The area has many retail establishments, restaurants, and entertainment venues. Higher sales taxes would have moderate impact given the spending power.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit access with multiple L lines (Red, Green, Orange), bus routes, and Metra stations. Also has good road access to downtown and expressways. Mixed-use development means many amenities are within walking distance. High car ownership but also high transit usage for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance transit improvements with moderate cost increases given high income levels. 2. Support driver fees to reduce congestion given dense urban environment. 3. Can accept higher fares/taxes since residents have capacity to absorb costs. 4. Value time savings from both transit and driving improvements. 5. Selected policies that provide best overall mobility improvements while maintaining reasonable costs. Ranked proposals that combine moderate-to-high driver fees with moderate transit fares and taxes, as these optimize travel times without excessive cost burden."
