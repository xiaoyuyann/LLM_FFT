    "disposable_income": "The Loop has one of the highest median household incomes in Chicago, with many residents working in professional and financial services. The average household income is well above $100,000, indicating high disposable income and ability to absorb transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power, with high levels of retail, dining, and entertainment expenditure. The impact of sales tax increases would be noticeable but manageable given the income levels",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent transit accessibility with multiple L lines, Metra stations, and bus routes. It also has high walkability scores. While many residents own cars, transit is a viable and widely-used option for most trips. Traffic congestion is a major concern during peak hours",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost sensitivity. 2. Support policies that reduce congestion and improve transit service quality. 3. Higher driver fees acceptable as they discourage driving and reduce congestion. 4. Moderate to higher transit fares acceptable given income levels. 5. Higher tax rates justified if they significantly improve transit service. Selected policies that balance these factors while maximizing travel time improvements for both modes"
