    "disposable_income": "Calumet Heights has a median household income of approximately $48,000, which is moderate for Chicago. The community has a significant middle-class population with stable employment, but many residents need to be mindful of transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. The community has a mix of homeowners and renters, with transportation costs representing a notable portion of household budgets. Higher sales taxes would impact household purchasing power",
    "accessibility": "The area is served by the Metra Electric District line and several bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles. The community is relatively far from downtown, making commute times and transportation reliability crucial factors. Car ownership is relatively high",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced options that don't overly burden residents with high sales taxes given moderate income levels. 2. Consider options that improve transit service while keeping fares affordable, as many residents use public transit for commuting. 3. Support moderate driving fees to reduce congestion while not excessively penalizing car-dependent residents. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility. 5. Select options that maintain reasonable car travel times for those who must drive"
