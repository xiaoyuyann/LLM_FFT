    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $33,000. About 28% of residents live below poverty level, making them highly sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Most income goes to basic necessities. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to public transit with Pink Line stations and multiple bus routes. About 30% of households don't own vehicles and rely on public transit. Many residents are transit-dependent for work commutes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fare + tax). 2. Need to maintain good transit service given high transit dependency. 3. Lower fares are critical for transit-dependent residents. 4. Moderate driving fees acceptable since many don't drive. 5. Selected policies balance keeping transit affordable while generating enough revenue for service quality through driving fees and moderate tax"
