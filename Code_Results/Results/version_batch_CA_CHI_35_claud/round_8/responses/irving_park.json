    "disposable_income": "Irving Park has a median household income of approximately $71,000, which is above Chicago's median. About 10% of residents live below poverty level. The community has a mix of middle-class and working-class households with moderate disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. The area has a significant number of homeowners with mortgage obligations. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets but not severely given the income levels.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with Blue Line, Metra UP-NW, and multiple bus routes. Car ownership is high at about 80% of households. Mixed-use development along commercial corridors means many amenities are accessible by both transit and car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that maintain transit service while not overly burdening drivers given high car ownership\n2. Moderate fare increases acceptable given income levels, but avoid highest fares\n3. Support some driving fees to reduce congestion and fund transit\n4. Prefer lower sales tax rates to preserve discretionary spending\n5. Value policies that reduce transit travel times given good existing transit infrastructure"
