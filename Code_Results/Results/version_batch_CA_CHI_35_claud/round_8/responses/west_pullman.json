    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has a median household income of approximately $37,000, significantly below Chicago's median. About 27% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income and high poverty rate, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a large portion of income on essential needs, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes",
    "accessibility": "The area is served by the Metra Electric line but has limited direct CTA rail access. Many residents rely on buses or personal vehicles. The community has a higher car ownership rate than might be expected given income levels, suggesting cars are seen as necessary despite their cost",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to limited household incomes and high poverty rate. 2. Favor moderate tax rates to balance service improvements with household budget constraints. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility. 5. Balance between car and transit improvements given mixed transportation needs of residents"
