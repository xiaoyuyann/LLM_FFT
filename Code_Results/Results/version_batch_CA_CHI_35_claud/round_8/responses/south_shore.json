    "disposable_income": "South Shore has a median household income of approximately $31,000, significantly below Chicago's median. About 32% of households live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income, discretionary spending is limited. Many households spend a large portion of income on necessities. Higher taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "South Shore has good transit access with Metra Electric and CTA bus routes. About 35% of households don't own vehicles and rely on public transit. The community has relatively high transit dependency",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize low transit fares and taxes to maintain affordability. 2. Support policies that improve transit service while keeping costs low for transit-dependent residents. 3. Moderate driving fees acceptable as fewer residents drive and fees can fund transit improvements. 4. Balance between service quality improvements and cost burden on low-income residents. 5. Consider policies that reduce transit travel times which are currently high at ~59 minutes"
