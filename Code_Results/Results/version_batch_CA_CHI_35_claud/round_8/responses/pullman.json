    "disposable_income": "Pullman has a median household income of approximately $41,000, which is below Chicago's median. Many residents have limited disposable income, making them sensitive to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. The community has significant retail gaps, requiring travel for many purchases. A 1.5% sales tax would notably impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "Pullman is served by Metra Electric District line and several CTA bus routes. Many residents rely on public transit, but service frequency and coverage could be improved. Car ownership is lower than city average, making transit accessibility crucial",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and lower incomes. 2. Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent trips. 3. Prefer lower sales tax rates to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden leads to middle-ground policies. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times without excessive cost increases"
