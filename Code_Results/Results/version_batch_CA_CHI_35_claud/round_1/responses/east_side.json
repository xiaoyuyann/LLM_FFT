    "disposable_income": "East Side is a working-class community with median household income around $47,000, below Chicago's average. Many residents work in manufacturing and industrial jobs, with significant budget constraints",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels. Residents are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees. Many households need to carefully budget for basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "Heavy reliance on both cars and public transit. Many residents commute to industrial jobs, some requiring car access. The area has bus services but limited rail access. Average commute times are significant factor",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower tax burden due to limited disposable income. 2. Balance between transit improvements and driving costs since community needs both modes. 3. Favor proposals with lower transit fares to help transit-dependent residents. 4. Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit without excessive burden on drivers. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce overall travel times while keeping costs manageable. Selected proposals 0, 1, 9, 3, 10 as they best balance these needs with emphasis on affordability"
