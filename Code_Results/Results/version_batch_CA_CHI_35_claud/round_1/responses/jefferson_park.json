    "accessibility": "The area is well-served by public transit with Blue Line station, Metra, and multiple bus routes. High car ownership rates with many households having 2+ vehicles. Good road access to expressways. Mixed transit/driving commuting patterns.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced options that don't overly burden middle-class residents with high taxes/fees\n2. Consider strong existing transit infrastructure and mixed-mode usage patterns\n3. Look for proposals that improve both transit and driving times without excessive cost increases\n4. Focus on options that maintain reasonable transit fares while introducing moderate driving fees to reduce congestion\n5. Avoid highest tax rates that would significantly impact discretionary spending\n6. Selected proposals 13, 10, 4, 11, 14 as they offer good balance of improved travel times, moderate costs, and reasonable tax rates"
