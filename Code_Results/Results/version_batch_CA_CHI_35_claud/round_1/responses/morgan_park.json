    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a median household income of approximately $57,000, which is moderate for Chicago. About 15% of residents live below poverty level, indicating a significant portion of the population needs to be mindful of transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has moderate discretionary spending power. Many households need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. The 1.5% tax rate would have a notable impact on household budgets",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park is served by Metra Rock Island Line but has limited CTA rail access. Many residents rely on cars for commuting. The community has a higher car ownership rate than the city average, but also has transit-dependent populations",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance driving and transit costs given mixed transportation needs. 2. Consider moderate tax rates to maintain service quality without overly burdening household budgets. 3. Look for policies that improve transit times while keeping fares affordable. 4. Selected policies that impose modest driving fees to fund transit improvements without excessive burden. 5. Favor proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit transit-dependent residents"
