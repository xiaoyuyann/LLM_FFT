    "disposable_income": "Washington Heights has a median household income of approximately $41,000, which is below Chicago's median. Many residents have limited disposable income and are sensitive to transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets. Many families need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "The community has access to Metra Rail (95th Street station) and several bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles. Transit commute times are significantly longer than driving. About 75% of households own vehicles, indicating a high dependence on cars despite the financial burden",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect limited discretionary income. 2. Balance between transit improvement and affordability - moderate fares ($1.25) are acceptable if they improve service. 3. Support modest driving fees ($0.50) to fund transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs manageable. 5. Consider the high car ownership rate but need for reliable transit alternatives"
