    "disposable_income": "O'Hare has a median household income above city average, with many residents working in aviation and hospitality industries. The community can generally absorb moderate transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity. Many households own cars and can afford higher transportation costs, but still value cost efficiency",
    "accessibility": "The area has good highway access (I-90, I-294) and Blue Line service, but transit times are longer due to distance from downtown. Most residents rely on cars, but airport workers often use transit",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance driving efficiency with reasonable fees since most residents drive. 2. Consider moderate transit fares to maintain service quality while keeping costs accessible for airport workers. 3. Prefer lower sales tax rates to preserve discretionary spending power. 4. Value proposals that reduce car travel times given the area's heavy reliance on driving. 5. Select policies that maintain transit service quality for airport employees"
