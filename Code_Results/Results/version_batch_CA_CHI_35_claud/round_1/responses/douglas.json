    "disposable_income": "Douglas has a median household income of approximately $35,000, significantly below Chicago's average. About 30% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a large portion of income on essential needs, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs and sales taxes",
    "accessibility": "Douglas has good transit access with Green Line stations and multiple bus routes. About 45% of residents use public transit for commuting, while 35% drive. Many residents are transit-dependent due to lower car ownership rates",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Prefer lower sales tax rates as residents have limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on low-income residents. 5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility to jobs and services"
