    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has a median household income of approximately $37,000, significantly below Chicago's median. About 27% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income and high poverty rate, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a large portion of income on essential needs, making them sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "The area is served by Metra Electric District line and several CTA bus routes, but transit service is less frequent compared to other parts of Chicago. About 75% of households own at least one vehicle, suggesting significant reliance on cars for mobility",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares and taxes due to limited disposable income. 2. Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on low-income residents. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time to improve accessibility. 5. Select options that maintain reasonable car travel times for car-dependent households"
