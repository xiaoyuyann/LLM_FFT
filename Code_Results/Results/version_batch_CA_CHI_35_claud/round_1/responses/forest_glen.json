    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is an affluent area with median household income around $106,000, well above Chicago average. Residents have relatively high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Most households own cars and have significant retail spending. Higher sales tax would have moderate but manageable impact on consumption",
    "accessibility": "Primarily car-dependent suburban-style area with limited transit access. Most residents drive, though some use Metra and buses. Car ownership rate is over 90%. Distance from downtown means longer commute times",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency and income levels, policies that improve driving times without excessive fees are preferred. 2. Higher sales tax is acceptable given income levels if it improves overall service. 3. Transit improvements still valuable as secondary option. 4. Moderate driving fees acceptable to reduce congestion. 5. Very high transit fares less concerning given income levels but should balance with driving costs. Selected policies balance these factors while maintaining reasonable costs for primary driving mode"
