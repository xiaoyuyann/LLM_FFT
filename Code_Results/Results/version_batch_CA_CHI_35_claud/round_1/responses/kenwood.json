    "disposable_income": "Kenwood has a mixed-income population with a median household income around $45,000. The area has significant economic diversity, with both affluent and moderate-income households. About 20% of residents live below poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. The community has a mix of professionals and working-class families. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets, particularly for lower-income residents.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has good transit access with multiple bus routes and proximity to Green Line and Metra. Car ownership is moderate at about 65%. The area is well-connected to downtown and nearby neighborhoods. Many residents rely on both transit and personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that don't overly burden lower-income residents while maintaining service quality. 2. Consider moderate tax rates to support transit without excessive impact on discretionary spending. 3. Support policies that improve transit times without extreme fare increases. 4. Look for options that reduce driving times for car-dependent residents. 5. Choose proposals that balance driver fees with improved service. Selected proposals 10, 13, 4, 19, and 22 offer good compromises between costs and benefits, with moderate tax rates and reasonable fare/fee structures that improve both transit and driving times."
