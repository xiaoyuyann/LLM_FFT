    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has moderate discretionary spending power. Many residents are working-class and middle-class families who need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. The area has a significant immigrant population who tend to be price-conscious consumers",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes and proximity to Red Line stations. About 30% of residents use public transit for commuting, while 60% drive.

    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that don't overly burden either drivers or transit users given mixed transportation needs. 2. Consider moderate tax rates to improve service while maintaining affordability. 3. Support policies that reduce transit travel times since many residents commute long distances. 4. Look for options that provide good transit service improvements without excessive costs. 5. Selected proposals 10, 13, 19, 4, and 22 as they offer good balance of reduced travel times, moderate costs, and service improvements through sustainable funding"
