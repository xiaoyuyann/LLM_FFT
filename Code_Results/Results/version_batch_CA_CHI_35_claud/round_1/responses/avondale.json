    "disposable_income": "Avondale has a median household income of around $57,000, which is slightly below Chicago's median. About 15% of residents live below poverty level, suggesting moderate financial constraints for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets significantly. Many residents need to balance essential expenses with transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Avondale has good access to CTA Blue Line and multiple bus routes. About 35% of residents use public transit for commuting, while 55% drive. The area has mixed transit-driving usage patterns, with many residents relying on both modes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending power. 2. Balance moderate transit fares ($1.25) with service quality given mixed transit-driving usage. 3. Support modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4. Consider travel time improvements for both modes given mixed usage. 5. Avoid highest cost combinations that would strain moderate-income households. Selected proposals balance service improvements with cost burden on mixed-mode community"
