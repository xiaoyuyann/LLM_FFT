    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a lower median household income around $30,000, with about 39% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents need to carefully balance essential needs with transportation costs. Higher sales taxes would have a significant impact on already constrained budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to CTA bus/rail services and is well-connected by public transit. Around 42% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transportation. The community has a high transit dependency rate.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden. 2. Many residents rely on transit, so transit service quality/travel time is important. 3. Lower driving fees are less critical since car ownership is low. 4. Selected proposals balance maintaining affordable transit access while generating enough revenue for service improvements. 5. Ranked proposals that minimize total cost burden while maximizing transit service improvements."
