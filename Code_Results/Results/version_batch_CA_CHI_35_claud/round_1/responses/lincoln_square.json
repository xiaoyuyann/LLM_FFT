    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Square is a middle to upper-middle income area with median household income around $77,000. Residents have moderate disposable income but are price-sensitive to transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Area has significant retail and entertainment spending, with many local businesses, restaurants and shops. Residents generally have good discretionary spending power but are value-conscious",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by Brown Line CTA, multiple bus routes, and good road network. High transit usage (40%+ commuters), but also significant car ownership. Mixed-use neighborhood with many amenities within walking/biking distance",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that maintain good transit service without excessive taxes/fees given middle-income demographics. 2. Support transit improvements as area has high transit usage. 3. Moderate driving fees acceptable as many residents use multiple modes. 4. Lower fares preferred to maintain transit affordability. 5. Consider policies that reduce congestion as area has dense mixed-use character. Selected policies balance transit service quality, reasonable costs, and improved travel times for both modes"
