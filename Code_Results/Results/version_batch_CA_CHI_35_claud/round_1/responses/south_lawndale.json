    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a relatively low median household income around $36,000, significantly below Chicago's average. About 28% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for most households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Most income goes to essential needs, making them particularly sensitive to any additional transportation costs or taxes",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to public transit with Pink Line stations and multiple bus routes. About 30% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. Many residents are transit-dependent for work commutes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) due to low income levels and high transit dependency. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-owning households. 4. Balance between improved transit times and affordability. 5. Consider proposals that reduce both transit and driving times to benefit all residents"
