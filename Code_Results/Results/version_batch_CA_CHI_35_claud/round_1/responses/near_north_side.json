    "disposable_income": "Near North Side has one of the highest median household incomes in Chicago (over $100,000). Residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending, with numerous luxury retail, dining, and entertainment venues. Residents typically spend more on goods/services, so sales tax impact is notable but manageable",
    "accessibility": "Excellent transit access with multiple L lines, bus routes, and walkable streets. High car ownership but also heavy traffic congestion. Many residents use mix of transit and driving depending on destination",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high income levels, prioritize time savings over cost sensitivity. 2. Support better transit service through moderate fees/taxes since many residents use both modes. 3. Favor balanced proposals that improve both transit and driving times. 4. Consider higher driver fees to reduce congestion in dense area. 5. Moderate sales tax increase acceptable given spending patterns. Selected proposals that optimize travel times while maintaining reasonable fees"
