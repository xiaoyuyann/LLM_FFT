    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch has a median household income of around $54,000, lower than Chicago's average. Many residents are working-class families with moderate disposable income, making them sensitive to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to moderate income levels. Residents need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "Hegewisch is geographically isolated on Chicago's far southeast side. Limited public transit options with only Metra South Shore Line and few bus routes. High car dependency due to distance from city center and limited transit coverage. Long commute times to major employment centers",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) due to limited discretionary income. 2. Favor moderate transit fares ($1.25) to balance service quality and affordability. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel times given long commutes. 5. Balance car costs since many residents rely on driving due to location"
