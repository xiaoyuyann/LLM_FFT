    "disposable_income": "Ashburn has a median household income of around $65,000, which is slightly above Chicago's median. However, with significant homeownership costs and family expenses, residents are cost-sensitive to transportation expenses",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Moderate discretionary spending capacity, with many working-class and middle-class families. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets, especially for larger families common in this area",
    "accessibility": "Heavily car-dependent community with limited public transit options. Most residents rely on personal vehicles, though some use Metra Rock Island line at the edge of the neighborhood. Long commute times to downtown and other employment centers",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that don't overly burden drivers given high car dependency\n2. Prefer lower sales tax rates due to moderate income levels and family budgets\n3. Balance driving fees to improve transit without excessive cost burden\n4. Consider policies that improve transit times while keeping fares moderate\n5. Selected proposals that maintain reasonable car travel times while gradually improving transit service"
