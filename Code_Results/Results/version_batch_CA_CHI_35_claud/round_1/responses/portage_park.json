    "disposable_income": "Middle-class neighborhood with median household income around $65,000. Many working families with moderate disposable income. About 10% poverty rate indicates some economic constraints",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Moderate discretionary spending capacity. Residents are price-sensitive but can afford some additional transportation costs. Many households have significant retail spending in local commercial districts",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transit access - served by Blue Line and multiple bus routes but not as extensive as downtown areas. High car ownership rates (80%+ households). Many residents commute by both car and transit. Good road network with access to expressways",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced options that don't overly burden middle-class residents with high taxes/fees. 2. Consider both transit and driving improvements since community uses both modes. 3. Moderate tax rate (1%) can fund improvements without excessive burden. 4. Lower transit fares beneficial for transit-dependent residents. 5. Small driving fees acceptable to reduce congestion. Selected proposals balance travel time improvements with moderate cost increases. Ranked based on overall community benefit vs cost burden"
