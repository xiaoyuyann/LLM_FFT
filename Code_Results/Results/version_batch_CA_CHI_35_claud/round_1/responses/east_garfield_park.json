    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park is a low-income community with median household income around $24,000, significantly below Chicago's average. About 42% of residents live below poverty level, indicating very limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high poverty rate and low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Most income goes to basic necessities. Higher taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with Green Line and Blue Line stations. About 42% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. The community faces some transportation barriers to accessing jobs and services",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) given low income levels and high transit dependency\n2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending\n3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers\n4. Balance between improved transit times and keeping costs affordable\n5. Consider proposals that reduce both transit and driving times to benefit all residents"
