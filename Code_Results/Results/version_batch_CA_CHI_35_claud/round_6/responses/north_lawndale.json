    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $25,000, with 43% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates very limited disposable income for transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high poverty rate and low income, discretionary spending is severely limited. Residents are highly sensitive to any additional costs from taxes, fares, or fees",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with Pink Line stations and bus routes, but 30% of households don't own vehicles. Many residents rely on public transit for essential trips to work, shopping, and services",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given very low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fares+tax+fees). 2. Need good transit service since many depend on it. 3. Lower transit fares are critical for this low-income community. 4. Moderate sales tax preferred as residents have limited retail spending. 5. Driving fees less impactful since car ownership is low. Selected policies balance minimal costs with improved transit service. Ranked based on combination of lowest fares, moderate taxes, and resulting transit times."
