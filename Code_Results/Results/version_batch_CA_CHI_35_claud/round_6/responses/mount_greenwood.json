    "disposable_income": "Mount Greenwood is a middle to upper-middle class area with median household income around $87,000. Many residents are city workers, particularly police and firefighters, with stable incomes. The area has one of the highest rates of homeownership in Chicago.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate to high discretionary spending power. The community has high car ownership rates and most households can absorb moderate increases in transportation costs without severe impact on other spending.",
    "accessibility": "The area is car-dependent with limited public transit options. Located on the far southwest side, it's relatively far from downtown. Most residents rely on personal vehicles. The area has Metra service but infrequent bus service. The 111th Street commercial corridor is the main shopping area.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, avoid highest driving fees to prevent excessive burden on residents. 2. Moderate tax increase acceptable to improve transit while maintaining driving viability. 3. Higher transit fares acceptable since most residents drive. 4. Prioritize policies that reduce car travel times since most commute by car. 5. Balance between maintaining reasonable driving costs while funding some transit improvements through moderate taxes and fees."
