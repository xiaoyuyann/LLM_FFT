    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $33,000. About 28% of residents live below the poverty line, making them highly sensitive to transportation costs and tax increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending. Most income goes to essential needs like housing, food, and transportation. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to public transit with Pink Line stations and multiple bus routes. Car ownership is lower than city average. Many residents rely on public transit for work commutes and daily activities. Walking and biking are also common modes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Minimize sales tax burden given limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without excessive burden. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that maintain affordable transit while generating some revenue for service improvements through driving fees"
