    "disposable_income": "McKinley Park is a working-class neighborhood with median household income around $47,000, below Chicago's average. Many residents work in manufacturing and service industries, making them sensitive to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to moderate income levels. Residents need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. Higher sales taxes would notably impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by public transit with Orange Line and multiple bus routes. Mixed transit-car usage pattern - about 30% use public transit for commuting while car ownership is moderate. Close to major employment centers and Interstate 55",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares and moderate taxes given income constraints. 2. Balance driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Favor proposals that reduce transit travel times to support working commuters. 4. Consider moderate sales tax options to maintain service quality. 5. Selected proposals that offer best travel time improvements while keeping costs manageable for working families"
