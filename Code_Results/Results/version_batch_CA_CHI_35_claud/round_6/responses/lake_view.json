    "disposable_income": "Lake View is an affluent area with median household income around $90,000. Residents have relatively high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs. Many residents work in professional services and have stable incomes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has high discretionary spending power, with numerous restaurants, entertainment venues, and retail shops. Residents frequently engage in recreational activities and dining out. Higher sales taxes would have a moderate but not severe impact on consumption patterns.",
    "accessibility": "Lake View has excellent transit access with multiple L lines (Red, Brown, Purple) and numerous bus routes. High walkability score and bike-friendly infrastructure. Many residents commute to downtown. Car ownership is lower than city average, with many households being car-free by choice.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that improve transit service given high transit usage in area. 2. Higher income means community can tolerate some fare/tax increases if they lead to better service. 3. Support driving fees to reduce congestion and fund transit since many residents don't drive. 4. Balance between service improvements and cost increases since many young professionals are price-sensitive. 5. Favor policies that reduce transit travel times most significantly since many residents rely on transit for commuting."
