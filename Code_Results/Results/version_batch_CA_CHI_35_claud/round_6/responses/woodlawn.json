    "disposable_income": "Woodlawn has a relatively low median household income around $25,000, with about 39% of residents living below poverty level. Many residents are cost-sensitive and have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets. Many residents rely on SNAP benefits and other assistance programs.",
    "accessibility": "About 42% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. The area is served by CTA Green Line and several bus routes. Many residents are transit-dependent for accessing jobs, services and amenities.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-owning households. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve access to opportunities. 5. Balance between service improvements and cost burden on low-income residents."
