    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $13,178. About 56% of households live below the poverty line, making residents extremely sensitive to any cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending. Most income goes to basic necessities. Any additional transportation costs or sales taxes would significantly impact already strained household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "Riverdale is relatively isolated with limited transit options. Many residents rely on public transit due to low car ownership rates (about 30% of households don't have vehicles). The community faces long commute times and accessibility challenges to jobs and essential services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest combined costs (low fares, low taxes) due to severe income constraints. 2. Need improved transit service given high transit dependency. 3. Lower driving fees preferred since some residents require cars for work. 4. Selected policies that balance service improvements with minimal cost burden. 5. Ranked options favoring lower transit fares over driving fees since more residents use transit."
