    "disposable_income": "O'Hare has a median household income above city average at around $67,000. Many residents work in airport-related industries or nearby business districts. The community has relatively high disposable income compared to many Chicago neighborhoods",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity. The area has many retail establishments and restaurants. Higher sales taxes would impact discretionary spending but most households can absorb moderate increases",
    "accessibility": "The area is highly car-dependent due to its location and layout. While served by the CTA Blue Line, many parts of O'Hare require driving. The community has high car ownership rates and many residents rely on driving for work commutes, especially airport workers with irregular hours",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, avoid highest driving fees to prevent excessive burden on residents who must drive. 2. Moderate tax increase acceptable to improve transit while maintaining discretionary spending power. 3. Higher transit fares acceptable since most residents drive. 4. Prioritize policies that reduce driving times given heavy traffic in area. 5. Balance between generating revenue for transit improvements while keeping costs reasonable for driving-dependent residents"
