    "disposable_income": "East Side is a working-class community with median household income around $47,000, below Chicago's average. Many residents work in manufacturing and industrial jobs, with significant budget constraints",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels. Residents are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees. Many households need to carefully budget for basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "Heavy reliance on both cars and public transit. Many residents commute to industrial jobs, some requiring car access. The area has bus services but limited rail access. Average commute times are significant factor",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower tax burden due to limited disposable income. 2. Balance between transit improvements and driving costs since community needs both modes. 3. Prefer moderate fares to maintain transit accessibility. 4. Consider proposals that reduce commute times without excessive cost burden. 5. Selected proposals 0, 3, 9, 12, and 4 as they offer reasonable balance between costs and travel time improvements while keeping tax burden manageable"
