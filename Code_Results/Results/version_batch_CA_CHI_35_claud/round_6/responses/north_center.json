    "disposable_income": "North Center is an affluent area with median household income around $110,000, significantly above Chicago's average. Residents have relatively high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Area has high discretionary spending power, with many residents spending on dining, entertainment, and retail. Higher sales tax would have moderate impact but not severely constrain spending habits",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by Brown Line, multiple bus routes, and major arterial roads. 71% of residents commute by car, 21% by transit. Area has good transportation options and infrastructure for both modes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high income levels, prioritize time savings over cost sensitivity. 2. Support policies that improve both transit and driving times since area uses both modes significantly. 3. Can absorb higher taxes/fees for better service. 4. Higher driver fees acceptable to reduce congestion. 5. Moderate transit fares to maintain ridership. Selected policies balance these factors while delivering good time savings for both modes"
