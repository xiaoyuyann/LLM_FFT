    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park is a low-income community with median household income around $24,000, significantly below Chicago's average. About 42% of residents live below poverty level, indicating very limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Many households rely on public assistance and must carefully budget essential expenses. Higher taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact their ability to afford basic needs",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with Green Line L and several bus routes. Car ownership is low at about 50% of households. Many residents are transit-dependent for accessing jobs, services and daily needs. Average commute times are higher than city average",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability\n2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending\n3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers\n4. Balance between improved transit times and keeping costs low for transit-dependent residents\n5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while maintaining affordability"
