    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge has a median household income of around $71,000, higher than Chicago's average. Many residents are middle-class working families with moderate disposable income. The area has a relatively high rate of homeownership, indicating stable housing costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending power but are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees. Many households own cars and make regular shopping trips to nearby commercial areas. The 1.5% tax rate would notably impact annual household budgets",
    "accessibility": "The area is car-dependent with good access to Midway Airport. Transit service is limited mainly to bus routes, with longer travel times to downtown. About 80% of residents drive to work, while 15% use public transit. The community needs balanced policies that don't overly burden drivers while maintaining transit service",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with moderate tax rates to balance revenue needs and household budgets. 2. Favor moderate driving fees to manage congestion while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3. Support lower transit fares to maintain affordability for transit users. 4. Consider proposals that reduce both car and transit travel times. 5. Selected proposals 13, 10, 4, 1, and 12 as they offer good balance between costs and benefits - maintaining reasonable driving costs while improving transit service through moderate fees and taxes"
