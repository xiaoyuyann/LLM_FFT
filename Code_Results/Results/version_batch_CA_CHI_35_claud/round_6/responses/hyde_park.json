    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to large student/academic population reliant on public transit\n2. Moderate tax rate acceptable given mixed-income profile and strong public benefits orientation\n3. Support higher driving fees as community has good transit alternatives\n4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times given high transit usage\n5. Balance need for transit system funding with affordability for lower-income residents"
