    "disposable_income": "Beverly is an upper-middle-class community with median household income around $94,000. Residents have relatively high disposable income compared to Chicago average, making them less sensitive to moderate fare/fee increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Many households can afford cars and have flexibility in transportation choices. Higher sales tax would have noticeable but manageable impact on discretionary spending",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by Metra Rock Island line with three stations. Good road network but some traffic congestion. Many residents commute downtown. Car ownership is high at around 90% of households. Mixed transit-car usage patterns",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance driving and transit improvements since Beverly uses both modes heavily. 2. Can tolerate moderate fees/taxes given income levels. 3. Focus on reducing transit travel times since many use Metra for downtown commutes. 4. Higher driver fees acceptable to fund transit and reduce congestion. 5. Moderate sales tax preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Selected policies that provide best travel time improvements while keeping costs reasonable for both modes"
