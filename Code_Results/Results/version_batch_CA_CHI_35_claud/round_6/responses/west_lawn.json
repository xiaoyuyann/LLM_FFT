    "disposable_income": "West Lawn is a middle-class community with median household income around $54,000. Many residents work in service and industrial sectors. The community has moderate disposable income but is price-sensitive to transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have modest discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets. Many families need to balance transportation costs with other essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "The community has moderate transit access with bus routes but no L train stations. Car ownership is high at around 85% of households. Many residents rely on driving for work commutes and daily activities. Travel times to downtown and other job centers are significant",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to preserve discretionary income for middle-class families. 2. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) can help improve transit without excessive burden on car-dependent residents. 3. Lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) benefit transit users while maintaining service quality. 4. Balance between car and transit travel times important as community uses both modes. 5. Selected proposals reduce transit travel times by 10-15% while keeping driving costs manageable"
