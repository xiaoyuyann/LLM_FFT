    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a lower median household income around $30,000, with about 39% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Many residents rely on essential purchases and are price-sensitive to both sales tax increases and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with Green and Red Line stations and multiple bus routes. About 42% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. Those who do drive face significant commute times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fare + tax) while maintaining service quality. 2. Strong transit dependency means transit travel times are critical. 3. Lower fares ($0.75) benefit the large transit-dependent population. 4. Moderate driving fees can help fund transit without overly burdening local drivers. 5. Higher sales tax is less preferred due to impact on essential purchases. Selected proposals balance these factors, with preference for low fares and moderate fees to support transit service while keeping overall costs manageable for residents."
