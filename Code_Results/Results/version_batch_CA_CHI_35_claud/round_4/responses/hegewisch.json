    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch has a median household income of around $54,000, lower than Chicago's average. Many residents are working-class families with moderate disposable income. The community has a higher percentage of homeowners but faces financial constraints",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher taxes and transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets. Many families need to carefully balance essential expenses with transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Hegewisch is geographically isolated on Chicago's far southeast side. Limited public transit options with only Metra service and some bus routes. High car dependency due to distance from city center and limited transit connectivity. Many residents commute long distances for work",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower tax burden due to moderate income levels (0.5% tax preferred). 2. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden - moderate fares ($1.25) acceptable if service improves. 3. Support modest driving fees to fund transit while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility. 5. Consider combined impact of all fees/taxes on household budgets. Selected proposals aim to improve transit service while maintaining affordability for working families"
