    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Square has a median household income of around $77,000, higher than Chicago's average. About 10% of residents live below poverty level. The community has a mix of middle and upper-middle-class households with moderate to good disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending power, with many local businesses, restaurants, and shopping areas. The community supports a vibrant commercial district along Lincoln Avenue. Higher sales taxes would impact discretionary spending but not severely given the income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by public transit with Brown Line stations at Western and Rockwell, multiple bus routes, and good road connectivity. About 35% of residents use public transit for commuting, 45% drive, and others walk or bike. The area has good walkability scores and mixed-use development patterns.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that maintain good transit service while keeping costs moderate given the mixed-mode transportation usage. 2. Consider moderate tax rates that won't overly burden discretionary spending but support transit. 3. Support driving fees to reduce congestion while improving transit times. 4. Look for proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit the significant transit-using population. 5. Choose options that maintain reasonable driving costs for the driving population while encouraging transit use. Selected proposals balance these factors while considering the community's mixed transportation needs and moderate-to-good income levels."
