    "disposable_income": "North Center is an affluent area with median household income around $110,000, significantly above Chicago's average. Residents have relatively high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Area has high discretionary spending power, with many residents spending on dining, entertainment, and retail. Higher sales tax would have moderate impact but not severely constrain spending habits",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by Brown Line, multiple bus routes, and major arterial roads. 71% of residents commute by car, 21% by transit. Area has good transportation options and infrastructure for both modes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high income levels, prioritize time savings over cost sensitivity\n2. Support policies that improve both transit and driving times since area uses both modes heavily\n3. Can absorb higher fees/taxes to fund better service\n4. Favor balanced approaches that improve transit without severely penalizing driving\n5. Higher driver fees acceptable as they reduce congestion and improve transit funding"
