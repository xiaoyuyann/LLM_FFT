    "disposable_income": "Beverly is an upper-middle-class community with median household income around $94,000. Residents have relatively high disposable income compared to Chicago average, making them less sensitive to moderate fare/fee increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending capacity. Many households can afford cars and have flexibility in transportation choices. Higher sales tax would have moderate impact given significant retail spending",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by Metra Rock Island line with multiple stations. Good road network but some distance from major highways. Mixed transit-car dependent area with above-average car ownership. Many residents commute downtown for work",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given higher incomes, prioritize time savings over cost sensitivity. 2. Consider balance of transit improvement funding via sales tax while maintaining reasonable fares. 3. Support driving fees to reduce congestion and fund transit, as community can generally afford it. 4. Focus on proposals that improve both transit and driving times, as residents use both modes. 5. Prefer moderate rather than highest tax/fee combinations given the community's mixed transportation needs"
