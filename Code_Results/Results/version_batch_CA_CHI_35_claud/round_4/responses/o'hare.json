    "disposable_income": "O'Hare has a median household income above city average, with many residents working in aviation and hospitality industries. The community can generally absorb moderate transportation costs",

    "accessibility": "The area has good highway access (I-90, I-294) and Blue Line service, but transit times are longer due to distance from downtown. Most residents rely on cars, but airport workers often use transit",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that balance driving efficiency with reasonable fees since most residents drive. 2. Consider moderate transit fares to maintain service quality while keeping costs accessible for airport workers. 3. Prefer lower sales tax rates to preserve discretionary spending. 4. Value policies that reduce car travel times given the area's distance from downtown. 5. Select options that maintain transit service quality without excessive costs"
