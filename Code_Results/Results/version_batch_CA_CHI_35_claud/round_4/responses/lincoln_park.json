    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Park is one of Chicago's most affluent neighborhoods with median household income over $115,000. Residents have high disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending on retail, dining, and entertainment. The community has significant retail corridors and residents tend to make frequent trips for shopping and leisure activities",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by public transit with multiple L lines (Brown, Purple, Red) and bus routes. High car ownership rates but also high walkability and bikeability. Many residents commute downtown for work",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, can tolerate higher fees/taxes to fund better service. 2. Many residents use both transit and cars, so balanced approach needed. 3. Reducing congestion important for quality of life. 4. Higher driver fees acceptable to encourage transit use. 5. Prefer policies that significantly improve transit times. Selected policies that combine moderate-to-high driver fees with moderate transit fares and taxes to optimize both modes while funding improvements. Ranked based on best overall travel time improvements while keeping costs reasonable for mixed-mode usage"
