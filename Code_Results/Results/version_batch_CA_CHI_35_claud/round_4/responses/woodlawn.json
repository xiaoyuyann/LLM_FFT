    "disposable_income": "Woodlawn has a relatively low median household income around $25,000, with about 39% of residents living below poverty level. Many residents are cost-sensitive and have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets. Many residents rely on SNAP benefits and other assistance programs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with Green Line stations and multiple bus routes. Car ownership is lower than city average at around 50%. Many residents are transit-dependent. The 63rd Street corridor is a key transportation artery.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Minimize sales tax burden given limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-owning residents. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Focus on proposals that benefit transit users while maintaining reasonable driving options."
