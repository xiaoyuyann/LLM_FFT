    "disposable_income": "South Deering has a lower median household income around $31,000, with about 30% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact their ability to afford basic necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The area is relatively transit-poor with limited bus service and no L train stations. Many residents rely on cars for mobility, but car ownership costs are burdensome. Average commute times are higher than city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest combined costs (sales tax + fares/fees) due to low income levels. 2. Balance transit improvements with affordability since many residents are transit-dependent. 3. Avoid high driving fees since many residents require cars for mobility. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times without excessive cost burden. 5. Selected proposals 0, 9, 3, 18, 21 as they offer reasonable transit improvements while keeping costs manageable through lower fees and moderate tax rates."
