    "disposable_income": "Hyde Park has a mixed income profile with a median household income around $53,000. Large student population from University of Chicago affects the overall income statistics. About 25% of residents live below poverty line while also having pockets of affluent households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Significant portion of residents are students and academics with moderate discretionary spending. Mixed retail environment with both basic necessities and higher-end establishments. Many residents balance education expenses with other needs",
    "accessibility": "Well-served by public transit with Metra Electric, CTA buses, and proximity to Green Line. High walkability score. Many residents are car-free by choice. Strong bicycle infrastructure. University of Chicago shuttle system supplements public transit",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that maintain affordable transit access given large student population and mixed income levels. 2. Lower transit fares more important than lower sales tax due to frequent transit use. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent trips. 4. Balance improved transit times with cost burden on lower-income residents. 5. Consider policies that reduce congestion around university area. Selected policies progressively improve transit times while keeping fares affordable and implementing moderate driving fees to fund improvements"
