Lower sales tax rates (0.5%) prioritized due to limited discretionary income\n3. Moderate transit fares ($1.25) balanced with maintaining service quality\n4. Avoiding highest driving fees ($1.00) as many residents rely on cars\n5. Seeking balance between car travel time improvements and cost burden"
