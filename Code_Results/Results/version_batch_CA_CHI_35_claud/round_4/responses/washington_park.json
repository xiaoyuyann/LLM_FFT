    "disposable_income": "Washington Park is one of Chicago's lowest-income communities with median household income around $25,000. Many residents live below poverty line and have very limited disposable income. High unemployment rate (~40%) further constrains household budgets.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Most income goes to basic necessities like housing, food, and utilities. Even small increases in transportation costs or taxes would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to CTA Green Line and bus routes. Car ownership rates are low (~40% of households). Many residents rely heavily on public transit for work, shopping, and services. Travel times by transit are significant concern given spatial mismatch between jobs and residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) given limited household incomes and high transit dependency. 2. Favor lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on already constrained budgets. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service without overly burdening the minority who drive. 4. Balance between improved transit times and keeping costs affordable. 5. Consider proposals that reduce both transit and driving times to benefit all residents."
