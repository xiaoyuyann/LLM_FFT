    "disposable_income": "Fuller Park has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $21,000. The poverty rate is approximately 40%, indicating very limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high poverty rate and low income levels, discretionary spending is extremely limited. Most household income goes to basic necessities like housing, food, and utilities. Even small increases in transportation costs or taxes would significantly impact residents' ability to meet basic needs.",
    "accessibility": "Fuller Park has good access to public transit with Red Line and Green Line stations and multiple bus routes. Car ownership rates are low due to economic constraints. Many residents rely heavily on public transportation to access jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given very low incomes, prioritize lowest possible combination of fares and taxes (0.5% tax, $0.75 fare)\n2. Need to maintain transit service quality for transit-dependent population\n3. Support driving fees to improve transit times and generate revenue without directly burdening transit users\n4. Balance between keeping transit affordable while generating enough revenue for service improvements\n5. Avoid highest tax rates that would strain limited discretionary spending"
