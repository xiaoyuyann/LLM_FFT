    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a median household income of around $54,000, slightly below Chicago's median. About 18% of residents live below poverty level. The community has a significant immigrant population with varying income levels",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Many households have limited discretionary spending capacity. The area has many working-class and middle-class families who are price-sensitive to transportation costs and sales tax increases",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with bus routes and is somewhat distant from L trains. About 30% of residents use public transit for commuting, while many depend on cars. The community has a significant elderly population who rely on both transit and driving",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending power of moderate-income residents. 2. Balance moderate transit fares ($1.25) with service quality improvements. 3. Support modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Consider travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transit-driving usage. 5. Avoid highest-cost combinations due to community's income constraints. Selected proposals balance affordability with service improvements"
