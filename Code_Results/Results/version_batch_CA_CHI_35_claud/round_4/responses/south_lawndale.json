    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a relatively low median household income around $36,000, with about 28% of residents living below poverty level. This indicates limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. The community has high price sensitivity for both sales tax and transit fares. Many households spend a significant portion of income on basic necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good access to CTA Pink Line and multiple bus routes. About 35% of households don't own vehicles and rely heavily on public transit. The community has a high proportion of workers using public transportation for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize proposals with lower fares and taxes to preserve disposable income. 2. High transit dependency means better transit service is important but must remain affordable. 3. Lower driving fees preferred since many residents are working-class and need cars for work. 4. Selected proposals balance improved transit service while minimizing cost burden. 5. Ranked proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping fares affordable for transit-dependent residents."
