    "disposable_income": "West Town has a relatively high median household income around $95,000, with many young professionals and families. Residents have moderate to high disposable income and can generally afford transportation costs",

    "accessibility": "Well-served by CTA Blue Line, multiple bus routes, bike lanes, and major arterial roads. Mixed-use development with good walkability. Many residents use multiple transportation modes regularly",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that improve both transit and driving times without excessive costs, given mixed-mode usage. 2. Higher income means moderate fees/taxes are acceptable if they improve service. 3. Focus on reducing transit travel times to encourage mode shift. 4. Consider policies that reduce congestion given dense urban environment. 5. Selected proposals balance service improvements with moderate cost increases, matching community's ability to pay and multi-modal needs"
