    "disposable_income": "Calumet Heights has a median household income of around $48,000, which is moderate for Chicago. The community has a significant middle-class population with many homeowners, but also has residents on fixed incomes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity. Many households need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. The 1.5% tax rate would notably impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "The area is served by the Metra Electric District line and several bus routes, but many residents rely on cars. The community is somewhat distant from major employment centers, making transportation costs and time significant factors",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize moderate tax rates to balance transit funding with household budgets. 2. Lower transit fares preferred due to significant transit-dependent population. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Focus on options that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility. 5. Consider balance between car and transit improvements as many residents use both modes"
