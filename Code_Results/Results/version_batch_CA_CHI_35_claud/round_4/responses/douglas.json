    "disposable_income": "Douglas has a median household income of approximately $35,000, significantly below Chicago's average. About 30% of residents live below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many households",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Many households spend a large portion of income on essential needs, making them sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Douglas has good transit access with Green Line stations and multiple bus routes. About 45% of households don't own cars. Many residents rely on public transit for work commutes and daily activities. The area has relatively good proximity to downtown Chicago",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low income levels. 2. Moderate tax rates to balance service funding with resident affordability. 3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-owning residents. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility. 5. Consider combined impact of all costs on low-income households"
