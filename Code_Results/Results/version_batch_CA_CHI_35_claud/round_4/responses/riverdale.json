    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has one of the lowest median household incomes in Chicago at around $14,000 annually. Over 40% of residents live below the poverty line, making disposable income extremely limited",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the very low income levels, discretionary spending is minimal. Most household income goes to basic necessities. Any additional transportation costs would significantly impact already strained budgets",
    "accessibility": "Riverdale is relatively isolated on the far South Side with limited transit options. Many residents rely on public transit due to low car ownership rates (around 30% of households). The community has among the longest average commute times in the city",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given extreme income constraints, prioritize lowest fares and taxes to preserve limited disposable income. 2. Need improved transit service given high transit dependency. 3. Driving fees less impactful since car ownership is low. 4. Focus on options that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs minimal. 5. Selected proposals balance service improvements with affordability - favoring 0.5-1.0% tax rates with lower fares"
