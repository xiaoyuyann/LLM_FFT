    "disposable_income": "Near North Side has one of the highest median household incomes in Chicago (over $100,000). Residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs without major impact on their lifestyle",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High levels of discretionary spending, with residents frequently engaging in shopping, dining, and entertainment. The area has numerous luxury retail stores and high-end restaurants. Higher sales tax would have minimal impact on consumption patterns",
    "accessibility": "Excellent transit access with multiple L lines (Red, Brown, Purple), numerous bus routes, and high walkability. Also has good road infrastructure but experiences heavy congestion. Many residents have options between driving and transit",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high income levels, prioritize time savings over cost savings. 2. Support policies that reduce congestion since area is densely populated with high traffic. 3. Higher driver fees acceptable to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. 4. Can absorb higher sales tax given affluent population. 5. Prefer balanced approach between transit improvement and driving efficiency. Selected proposals that combine higher driver fees with moderate-to-high sales tax to fund transit improvements, while keeping transit fares reasonable to encourage usage"
