    "disposable_income": "O'Hare is a middle-income community with a mix of residential and commercial areas. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some flexibility in spending but with a need to manage costs effectively.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in O'Hare have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services. The community values affordability in transportation to maintain their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "O'Hare has good access to public transportation, including the Blue Line and bus services, but also relies heavily on driving due to its proximity to the airport and major highways. Reducing travel time and cost is important for both modes of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and the need for affordable transportation, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial. Reducing travel time is also a priority to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals that offer reduced travel times and costs, while maintaining a reasonable tax rate, are prioritized. The community is willing to accept a slightly higher tax if it results in significant improvements in transit service and reduced travel times."
