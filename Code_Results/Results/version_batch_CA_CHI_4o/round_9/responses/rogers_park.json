    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a diverse population with varying income levels, but generally, it is a middle-income area with a significant portion of residents relying on public transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Rogers Park have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services. The community values affordable living costs.",
    "accessibility": "Rogers Park is well-served by public transit, including the CTA Red Line and several bus routes, making transit accessibility a key factor for residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the reliance on public transit and the moderate income levels, the community would benefit from policies that maintain or reduce transit fares while improving service times. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it significantly reduces car travel time and congestion, encouraging a shift to public transit. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced transit fares, moderate driver fees, and manageable sales tax rates, leading to improved transit times and reduced car travel times."
