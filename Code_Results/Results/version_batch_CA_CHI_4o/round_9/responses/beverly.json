    "disposable_income": "Beverly is a middle to upper-middle-class neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can afford moderate increases in transportation costs but would prefer to maintain a balance to ensure discretionary spending is not heavily impacted.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Beverly have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services. They value maintaining this lifestyle and would prefer policies that do not significantly reduce their disposable income.",
    "accessibility": "Beverly has good access to public transportation, including Metra train services, which are frequently used by residents for commuting. However, many residents also rely on personal vehicles for convenience and flexibility. Policies that improve transit times and reduce congestion are favorable.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Beverly's higher disposable income and reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit efficiency and reduce congestion without significantly increasing costs. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driving fees are preferred to encourage public transit use while maintaining affordability. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and reasonable costs, ensuring that residents can maintain their discretionary spending while benefiting from improved transportation services."
