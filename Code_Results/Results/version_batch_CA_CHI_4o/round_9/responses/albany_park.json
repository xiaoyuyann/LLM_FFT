    "disposable_income": "Albany Park has a moderate level of disposable income, with a diverse population that includes a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as many residents rely on public transit for commuting.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community's discretionary consumption is moderate, with residents spending on essentials and some discretionary items. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Albany Park has good access to public transit, with several CTA bus routes and the Brown Line serving the area. However, travel times can be long, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial. Car ownership is moderate, and reducing congestion and travel times for drivers is also important.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to significant improvements in transit services. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is a priority to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals that balance lower costs with improved travel times are prioritized."
