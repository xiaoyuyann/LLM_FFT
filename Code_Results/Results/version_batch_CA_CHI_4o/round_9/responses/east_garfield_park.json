    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are likely to prioritize essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in East Garfield Park due to lower car ownership rates. Accessibility to jobs, education, and healthcare via transit is vital.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. However, improving transit service is also important to enhance accessibility. A balance between cost and service improvement is necessary. Lower sales tax rates are preferred to avoid further reducing disposable income. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that also reduce travel time are prioritized. The decision aims to improve transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for residents."
