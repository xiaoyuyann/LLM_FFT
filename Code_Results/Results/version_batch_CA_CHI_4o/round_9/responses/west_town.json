    "disposable_income": "West Town is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, but generally has a moderate to high disposable income due to its gentrification and proximity to downtown Chicago.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in West Town have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and retail being significant due to the area's vibrant cultural scene.",
    "accessibility": "West Town has good accessibility to public transit, with several bus routes and train lines serving the area. However, traffic congestion can be an issue for drivers, especially during peak hours.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slightly higher transit fare if it results in better service and reduced travel time. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing car travel time is also important due to congestion issues. Therefore, proposals that balance a moderate fare and tax with improved transit times and reduced car travel times are prioritized. Proposals with a $0.75 fare and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion."
