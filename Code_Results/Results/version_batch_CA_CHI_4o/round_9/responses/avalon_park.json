    "disposable_income": "Avalon Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for essential and discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Avalon Park has moderate access to public transit, with some reliance on personal vehicles. Improving transit times and reducing congestion are important to enhance accessibility to jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance the budget impact and improve transit service. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit service. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing travel time and costs for both transit users and drivers, while ensuring that the community can still afford other essential expenses."
