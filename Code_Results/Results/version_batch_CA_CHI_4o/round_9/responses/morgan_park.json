    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income households. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but there is some flexibility to absorb minor increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban nature of the area. Reducing travel time and improving transit services are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both transit and driving, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost and service improvements. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use while maintaining affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving service without overly burdening residents financially."
