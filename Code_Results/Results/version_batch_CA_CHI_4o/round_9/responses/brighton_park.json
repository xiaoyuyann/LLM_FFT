    "disposable_income": "Brighton Park is a working-class neighborhood with a moderate to low average household income. Many residents rely on public transportation for commuting, and any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential expenses, and any additional costs from transportation policies could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Brighton Park has decent access to public transportation, with several bus routes and nearby train stations. However, travel times can be long, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial. Car ownership is lower than in more affluent areas, so public transit is crucial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision-making process involves balancing the need for affordable transit options with the desire for improved service and reduced travel times. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it leads to significant improvements in transit efficiency and reduced congestion. The selected proposals aim to provide a balance between affordability and improved transit service, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and limited discretionary income."
