    "disposable_income": "Hermosa is a working-class neighborhood with a moderate level of disposable income. Many residents are employed in blue-collar jobs, and the community has a significant number of families with children.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential expenses such as housing, food, and education, with less room for luxury or non-essential spending.",
    "accessibility": "Hermosa has moderate access to public transportation, with some reliance on buses and trains. Car ownership is common, but not universal, and many residents depend on public transit for commuting to work and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision-making process involves balancing the cost of transportation with the need for efficient and accessible transit options. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to ensure affordability for residents who rely on public transportation. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Reducing travel time is important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals that offer a balance between cost and improved transit times are prioritized."
