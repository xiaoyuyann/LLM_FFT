    "disposable_income": "Roseland has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Roseland has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit service could greatly benefit residents who rely on it for commuting and accessing services. Car ownership is lower than average, so transit improvements are crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower income levels, minimizing costs is a priority. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred, as they balance cost savings with potential transit improvements. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel time by transit while keeping costs manageable for residents."
