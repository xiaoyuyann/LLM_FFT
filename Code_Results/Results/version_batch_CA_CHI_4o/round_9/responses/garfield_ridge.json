    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and non-essential goods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, food, and transportation being significant. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on other discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "Garfield Ridge has moderate accessibility to public transit, with some reliance on driving due to the community's layout and available services. Reducing travel time and improving transit services could benefit residents, but cost increases need to be carefully considered.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on balancing cost with improved service. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use while keeping costs manageable. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on disposable income. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel time and improve transit service without significantly increasing costs for residents."
