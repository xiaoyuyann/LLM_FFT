    "disposable_income": "The East Side community has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs. This means that any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "The East Side has limited access to public transportation, making it crucial to improve transit services. Many residents rely on cars, but reducing travel time and improving transit could encourage a shift to public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision focuses on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to keep costs manageable while encouraging a shift from driving to transit. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The goal is to reduce travel time and costs for both drivers and transit users, while ensuring that any additional costs do not overly burden residents with limited disposable income."
