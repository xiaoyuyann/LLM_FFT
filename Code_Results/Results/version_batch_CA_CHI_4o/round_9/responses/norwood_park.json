    "disposable_income": "Norwood Park is a middle-income community with a relatively stable economic base. Residents generally have a moderate level of disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in spending but also requires careful budgeting.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to spend on essential goods and services, with some discretionary spending on leisure and non-essential items. However, any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to maintain current levels of discretionary consumption.",
    "accessibility": "Norwood Park has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban nature of the area. Reducing travel times and improving transit services could encourage more residents to use public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, Norwood Park would benefit from policies that balance cost with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' budgets. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs while maintaining a reasonable level of service and accessibility."
