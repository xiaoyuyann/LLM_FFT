    "disposable_income": "Lake View is a relatively affluent community with a higher-than-average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can generally afford moderate increases in transportation costs without significant impact on their overall financial well-being.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake View have a diverse range of discretionary spending habits, including dining, entertainment, and retail. While they can absorb some increases in transportation costs, significant increases could impact their discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Lake View has good access to public transportation, with multiple CTA train and bus lines serving the area. The community is also bike-friendly and walkable, reducing reliance on cars for many residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and good public transit access, Lake View can support policies that slightly increase costs if they lead to better transit services and reduced congestion. A balance between fare, tax, and driving fees is essential to maintain affordability while improving service. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to encourage transit use, while moderate driving fees can help reduce congestion and emissions. The selected policies aim to improve transit times and service quality without overly burdening residents financially."
