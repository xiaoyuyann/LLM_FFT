    "disposable_income": "Uptown is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, including both low-income and middle-income residents. The disposable income varies significantly across the community, with some residents having limited financial flexibility.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services. However, a significant portion of the population may prioritize basic needs over discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Uptown has good access to public transportation, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times by transit are relatively long compared to driving, which can be a barrier for some residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the diverse income levels in Uptown, policies that minimize costs while improving transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The goal is to balance affordability with improved accessibility and reduced travel times."
