    "disposable_income": "West Lawn is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "West Lawn has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a viable option for many, but driving is also common due to the need for flexibility and time efficiency. Reducing travel time and maintaining affordable transit fares are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving travel times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance the budget impact and improve transit services. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on overall consumption. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel time for both transit and driving, while keeping costs manageable for residents."
