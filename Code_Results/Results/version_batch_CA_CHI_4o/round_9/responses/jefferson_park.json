    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some flexibility in spending but with a need to manage costs carefully.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jefferson Park have moderate discretionary spending, with priorities on housing, education, and transportation. The community values affordability and cost-effectiveness in daily expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Jefferson Park has good access to public transportation, including the CTA Blue Line and several bus routes. Car ownership is common, but public transit is a viable option for many residents. Accessibility to resources and services is generally good, but improvements in transit efficiency could benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, Jefferson Park residents would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use while keeping costs manageable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to significant improvements in transit efficiency. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while supporting transit infrastructure through reasonable taxation."
