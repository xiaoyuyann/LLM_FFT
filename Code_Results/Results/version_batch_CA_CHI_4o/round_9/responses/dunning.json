    "disposable_income": "Dunning is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but they can absorb moderate increases if they lead to significant improvements in service.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, food, and transportation being significant. Any increase in transportation costs should be justified by tangible benefits in service quality or time savings.",
    "accessibility": "Dunning has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit options are available but not as efficient as in more central areas. Improvements in transit times and service quality would be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and current accessibility, the focus is on balancing cost with improvements in transit service and travel time. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing travel time and improving service quality while keeping costs manageable for residents."
