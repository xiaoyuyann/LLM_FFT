    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Near West Side have a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and retail being significant due to the area's proximity to downtown and cultural attractions.",
    "accessibility": "The Near West Side is well-served by public transit, including multiple CTA train lines and bus routes, providing good accessibility to downtown and other parts of the city. Car ownership is moderate, with some residents relying on driving for convenience.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, it is important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use while maintaining affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel time is also a priority to enhance accessibility and convenience for residents. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable travel times are prioritized."
