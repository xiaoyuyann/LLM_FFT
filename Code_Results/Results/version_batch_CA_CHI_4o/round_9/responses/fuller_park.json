    "disposable_income": "Fuller Park is one of the lower-income areas in Chicago, with a median household income significantly below the city average. Residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Fuller Park has limited access to public transportation options, and many residents rely on driving. Improving transit accessibility and reducing travel times could benefit the community, but affordability remains a key concern.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the economic constraints of Fuller Park, policies with lower fares and taxes are prioritized to minimize financial burden. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, the selected policies aim to provide affordable and efficient transportation options. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it results in better transit services, as long as the overall cost remains manageable for residents."
