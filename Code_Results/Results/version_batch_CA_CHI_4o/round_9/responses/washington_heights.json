    "disposable_income": "Washington Heights has a moderate to low average disposable income, with many residents relying on public transportation for commuting. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can significantly impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary spending in Washington Heights is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Public transportation is a crucial mode of transport in Washington Heights, providing access to jobs, education, and other services. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income and reliance on public transportation, the community would benefit from policies that lower transit fares and improve service times without significantly increasing costs. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The community would also benefit from reduced driving times, which could be achieved through higher driver fees that encourage transit use. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and lower sales taxes are prioritized to balance affordability and improved service."
