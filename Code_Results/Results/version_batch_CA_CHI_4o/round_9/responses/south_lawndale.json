    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "South Lawndale has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower income levels, minimizing costs is crucial. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and taxes are preferred. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, but significant improvements in transit times, are prioritized. The decision aims to reduce travel time while keeping costs manageable for residents."
