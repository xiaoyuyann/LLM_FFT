    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, but generally has a higher average income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents have a moderate to high level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher average income, residents of the Near South Side have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption. They are likely to spend on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The Near South Side has good access to public transportation, including several CTA train lines and bus routes. It is also close to downtown Chicago, making it convenient for both transit and driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community can afford a slightly higher sales tax and transit fare if it results in significantly improved transit services. The community values reduced travel times and improved transit services, which can enhance accessibility and reduce congestion. Therefore, proposals that balance a moderate increase in costs with significant improvements in transit times and services are prioritized. The community is willing to accept a higher sales tax and driver fee if it leads to better transit options and reduced car travel times, as this aligns with their preference for efficient and accessible transportation."
