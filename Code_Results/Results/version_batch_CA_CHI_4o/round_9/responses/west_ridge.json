    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a diverse population with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households. The community has a significant number of residents who rely on public transportation, and disposable income varies widely across different demographics.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community's discretionary consumption is moderate, with residents spending on essentials and some discretionary items. The community values affordable transportation options to maintain their standard of living.",
    "accessibility": "West Ridge has decent access to public transportation, with several bus routes and proximity to the CTA Red Line. However, travel times can be long, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial. Car ownership is moderate, and congestion can be an issue during peak hours.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transportation and the need for affordable options, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, so proposals that improve transit efficiency and reduce car travel time are favored. Balancing the cost of living with improved transit services is crucial, so proposals with moderate driver fees that encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers are preferred. The community would benefit from a policy that maintains or reduces current costs while improving service efficiency."
