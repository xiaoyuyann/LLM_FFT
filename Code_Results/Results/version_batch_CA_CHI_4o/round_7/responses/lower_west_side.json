    "disposable_income": "The Lower West Side has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of working-class and middle-income households. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for essential and discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption in the Lower West Side is moderate, with residents spending on local businesses, dining, and cultural activities. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the amount of money available for these activities.",
    "accessibility": "The Lower West Side has decent access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times can be long, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial. Car ownership is moderate, and reducing congestion and travel times for drivers is also important.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and reliance on both public transit and driving, the ideal policy would balance lower costs with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit efficiency. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while considering the impact on discretionary spending."
