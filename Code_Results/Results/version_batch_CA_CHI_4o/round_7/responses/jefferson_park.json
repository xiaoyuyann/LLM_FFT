    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and professional residents. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some flexibility in spending but with a need to manage costs effectively.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jefferson Park have moderate discretionary spending, with priorities on housing, education, and transportation. The community values affordability and cost-effectiveness in daily expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Jefferson Park has good access to public transportation, including the CTA Blue Line and several bus routes. Car ownership is common, but public transit is a viable option for many residents. Accessibility to resources and services is generally good, but improvements in transit efficiency and cost could benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, Jefferson Park residents would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage public transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The community would prefer policies that reduce travel time and cost for both transit and driving, without imposing high additional costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, coupled with reasonable sales tax rates, are prioritized."
