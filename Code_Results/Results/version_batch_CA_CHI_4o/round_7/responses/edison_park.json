    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents of Edison Park likely have higher discretionary spending on non-essential goods and services. However, they may still be sensitive to significant increases in transportation costs that could impact their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Edison Park has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban nature of the area. Reducing driving times and improving transit efficiency could be beneficial, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision focuses on balancing cost and efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability while improving transit times. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The community values reduced travel times, especially for driving, given the reliance on cars. Therefore, proposals that offer a good balance of reduced travel times and reasonable costs are prioritized."
