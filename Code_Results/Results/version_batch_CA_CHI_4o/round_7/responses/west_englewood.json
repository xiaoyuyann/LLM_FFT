    "disposable_income": "West Englewood has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Due to lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, taxes, and fees.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in West Englewood, as car ownership is lower than in other areas. Accessibility to jobs, education, and services is heavily reliant on efficient and affordable public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, the community would benefit from lower transit fares and minimal increases in sales tax and driving fees. The goal is to improve transit efficiency without significantly increasing costs for residents. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A balance between improving transit services and maintaining affordability is crucial."
