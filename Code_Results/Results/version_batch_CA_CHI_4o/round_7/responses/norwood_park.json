    "disposable_income": "Norwood Park is a middle-income community with a relatively stable economic base. Residents generally have a moderate level of disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in spending but also requires careful budgeting.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to spend on essential goods and services, with some discretionary spending on leisure and non-essential items. However, any increase in transportation costs could impact the ability to spend on these discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "Norwood Park has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban nature of the area. Reducing travel time and improving transit services could encourage more residents to use public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transportation with the benefits of improved services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Reducing travel time is also a priority to make transit more attractive. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable travel times are prioritized."
