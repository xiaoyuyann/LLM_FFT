    "disposable_income": "Washington Heights has a moderate to low average disposable income, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as fares and fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income going towards essential expenses. Therefore, any increase in transportation costs could impact the ability to spend on other necessary goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Washington Heights has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but travel times are relatively long, and improvements in transit efficiency could significantly benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income and limited discretionary consumption, it is important to prioritize policies that minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use and reduce congestion, improving travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on disposable income. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also offer reduced travel times, are prioritized. The tradeoff between fare, tax, and driver fee is balanced to ensure affordability and improved transit service."
