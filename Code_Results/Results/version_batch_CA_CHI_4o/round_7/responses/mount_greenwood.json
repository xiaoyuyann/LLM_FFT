    "disposable_income": "Mount Greenwood is a middle-class community with a relatively stable disposable income. Residents have a moderate level of financial flexibility, allowing them to absorb some increases in transportation costs, but significant increases could impact their discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, education, and leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the budget available for these activities.",
    "accessibility": "Mount Greenwood has moderate access to public transit, with many residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting. Improvements in transit services could benefit the community, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on personal vehicles and moderate use of public transit, proposals that balance improved transit times with reasonable costs are preferred. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are favorable to encourage a shift to public transit without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it results in tangible improvements in transit services. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between cost and improved transit efficiency, considering the community's income and spending patterns."
