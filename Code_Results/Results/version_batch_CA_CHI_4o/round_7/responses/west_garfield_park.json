    "disposable_income": "West Garfield Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Due to lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, taxes, and fees.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for residents in West Garfield Park, as car ownership is lower than in other areas. Accessibility to jobs, education, and services heavily relies on efficient and affordable public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, the community would benefit from policies that minimize fare increases and driver fees while maintaining or improving transit service quality. A lower sales tax is also preferred to avoid further reducing disposable income. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and driver fees, even with a slightly higher sales tax, are prioritized to ensure affordable and efficient transit options. The selected proposals balance the need for affordable transit with the potential for improved service through reasonable funding mechanisms."
