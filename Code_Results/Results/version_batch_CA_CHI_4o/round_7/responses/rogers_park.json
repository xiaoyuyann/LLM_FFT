    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a diverse population with a mix of income levels, but generally, it has a moderate disposable income. Many residents are students or young professionals who may not have high disposable incomes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a variety of local businesses, restaurants, and cultural activities, indicating a moderate level of discretionary consumption. Residents value affordability in transportation to maintain their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Rogers Park is well-served by public transit, including the Red Line and several bus routes. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting, and there is a significant number of car owners as well.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Reducing travel time is important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals that balance lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable travel times are prioritized."
