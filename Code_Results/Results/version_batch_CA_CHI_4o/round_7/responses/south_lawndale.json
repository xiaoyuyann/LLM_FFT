    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, discretionary spending is already constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could further limit spending on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "South Lawndale has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on it for commuting. Car ownership is lower than average, so transit improvements are crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower income levels, minimizing costs is a priority. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred, as they balance cost savings with potential transit improvements. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to reduce transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents."
