    "disposable_income": "Armour Square has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and working-class residents. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as a significant portion of income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Armour Square have limited discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Armour Square has decent access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times by transit are relatively long compared to driving, which is a concern for residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to minimize additional costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on overall consumption. The selected proposals aim to balance cost savings with improved transit times, benefiting both transit users and drivers in the community."
