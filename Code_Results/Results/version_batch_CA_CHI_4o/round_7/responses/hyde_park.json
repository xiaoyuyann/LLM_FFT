    "disposable_income": "Hyde Park is a diverse community with a mix of students, professionals, and long-term residents. The presence of the University of Chicago contributes to a range of income levels, with some residents having higher disposable incomes, while students and lower-income residents may have less.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a variety of local businesses, restaurants, and cultural institutions, indicating a moderate level of discretionary consumption. Residents may prioritize spending on education, dining, and cultural activities.",
    "accessibility": "Hyde Park has good access to public transportation, including buses and the Metra train, which connects to downtown Chicago. However, transit times can be lengthy, and driving is a common alternative for those with access to a vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the diverse income levels and the importance of both transit and driving in Hyde Park, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use while reducing congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and moderate driver fees to improve transit times without overly burdening residents financially."
