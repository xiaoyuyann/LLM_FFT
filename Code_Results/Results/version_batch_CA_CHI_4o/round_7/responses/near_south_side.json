    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side is a diverse area with a mix of income levels, but generally has a higher average income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents have a moderate to high level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Near South Side tend to have higher discretionary spending due to their higher disposable income. They spend on dining, entertainment, and other leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The Near South Side has good access to public transportation, including buses and trains, making it convenient for residents to use transit. However, driving is also common due to the proximity to downtown and major highways.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher fares and fees if it results in better transit services and reduced travel times. The community values efficient transportation options that reduce congestion and improve air quality. Therefore, proposals that balance moderate fare increases with improved transit times and reduced driving times are preferred. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving service quality while maintaining reasonable costs."
