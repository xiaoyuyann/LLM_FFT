    "disposable_income": "West Lawn is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "West Lawn has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a viable option for many, but driving is also common due to the need for flexibility and time efficiency. Reducing travel time and improving transit services are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A balanced sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reduced travel times and costs, with a slight preference for lower fares and moderate driver fees to balance the community's needs."
