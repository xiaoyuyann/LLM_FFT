    "disposable_income": "Oakland is a community with a moderate to low average disposable income. Many residents may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, discretionary consumption is likely limited. Residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget for other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Oakland has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but driving is also common. Improvements in transit times could benefit the community, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision focuses on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Proposals that reduce travel time without significantly increasing costs are prioritized. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it leads to better transit services and reduced congestion. The top choices reflect a preference for maintaining or slightly improving current costs while enhancing service efficiency."
