    "disposable_income": "The Near North Side is one of the more affluent areas in Chicago, with a higher average disposable income compared to other communities. Residents can generally afford higher transportation costs, but they also value efficient and convenient transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher disposable income, residents of the Near North Side have significant discretionary spending on dining, entertainment, and luxury goods. They are likely to prioritize policies that enhance convenience and reduce travel time, even if it means slightly higher costs.",
    "accessibility": "The Near North Side has good access to public transit, with multiple CTA train lines and bus routes. However, traffic congestion can be an issue, making efficient transit options appealing. Residents value reduced travel times and improved transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's higher income and discretionary spending, the focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit services. A moderate increase in sales tax and driver fees is acceptable if it leads to significant improvements in transit efficiency. The community is likely to support policies that balance cost with reduced travel times and enhanced transit services. Therefore, proposals with higher driver fees and moderate sales tax rates that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
