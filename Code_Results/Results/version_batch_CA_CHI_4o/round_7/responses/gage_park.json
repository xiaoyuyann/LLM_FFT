    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income below the city average. Residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Gage Park has moderate access to public transit, with several bus routes and a nearby train line. However, transit times are relatively long, and many residents rely on driving for faster commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that minimize costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. Policies that reduce driving times are also favored, as they can benefit those who rely on cars. The tradeoff between lower costs and improved transit services is carefully balanced to ensure affordability and accessibility."
