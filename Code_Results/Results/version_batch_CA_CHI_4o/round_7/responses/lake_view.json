    "disposable_income": "Lake View is a relatively affluent community with a higher-than-average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can generally afford moderate increases in transportation costs without significant impact on their overall financial well-being.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake View have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and other leisure activities. They value convenience and time savings, which can influence their transportation choices.",
    "accessibility": "Lake View has good accessibility to public transit, with several CTA train lines and bus routes serving the area. However, traffic congestion can be an issue, making efficient transit options appealing to reduce travel time.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's higher disposable income and preference for convenience, policies that reduce travel time while maintaining reasonable costs are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Lower transit fares are preferred to encourage public transit use, but a reasonable driver fee is acceptable if it reduces congestion and travel time. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors, offering reduced travel times and maintaining or slightly increasing costs to support better transit services."
