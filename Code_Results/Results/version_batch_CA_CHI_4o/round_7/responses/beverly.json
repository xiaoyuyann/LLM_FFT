    "disposable_income": "Beverly is a middle to upper-middle-class neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can afford moderate increases in transportation costs but still value cost-effectiveness.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Beverly have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods. They are likely to be sensitive to changes in disposable income due to increased transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Beverly has good access to public transportation, including Metra rail services, which are frequently used by residents for commuting. However, many residents also rely on personal vehicles for convenience and flexibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Beverly's higher disposable income, residents can handle a moderate increase in transportation costs if it results in better services. However, they would prefer to minimize additional costs to maintain their discretionary spending. The community values efficient transit options to reduce travel time, especially for those commuting to downtown Chicago. Therefore, proposals that balance lower fares and moderate driver fees with improved transit times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between cost, improved transit times, and maintaining discretionary spending."
