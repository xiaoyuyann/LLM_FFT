    "disposable_income": "Kenwood is a diverse community with a mix of middle to upper-middle-income residents. The disposable income varies, but there is a significant portion of the population that can afford moderate increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kenwood have a moderate level of discretionary consumption. They spend on housing, dining, and cultural activities, but are sensitive to significant increases in transportation costs that could impact their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has good access to public transit, with several bus routes and proximity to the Metra Electric Line. However, driving is also common, and reducing congestion and travel time is a priority.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income levels and spending habits, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability while improving transit services. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit efficiency. Reducing travel time for both transit and driving is crucial, as it improves accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals that balance these factors are prioritized."
