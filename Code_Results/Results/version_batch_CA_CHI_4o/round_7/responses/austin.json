    "disposable_income": "Austin is a community with a median household income lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Austin has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could enhance accessibility to jobs and services. Many residents rely on public transit, but some also drive, so both modes are important.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel times, as this could improve access to employment and services. The balance between cost and improved transit service is crucial, given the community's economic constraints."
