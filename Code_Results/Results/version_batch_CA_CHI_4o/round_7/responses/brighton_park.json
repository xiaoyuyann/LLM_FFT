    "disposable_income": "Brighton Park is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income lower than the city average. Many residents are employed in blue-collar jobs, and the community has a significant immigrant population.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower median income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential expenses such as housing, food, and transportation, with less room for luxury or non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Brighton Park has moderate access to public transportation, with several bus routes and a nearby CTA Orange Line station. However, transit times can be lengthy, and many residents rely on cars for commuting to work and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the community's lower disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and minimal sales tax increases are preferred to minimize financial strain. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can encourage a shift from driving to transit and reduce congestion, are prioritized. The balance between improving transit services and keeping costs manageable for residents is crucial."
