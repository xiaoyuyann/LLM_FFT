    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are likely to prioritize essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in East Garfield Park due to lower car ownership rates. Accessibility to jobs, education, and services is heavily reliant on efficient and affordable public transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, it is important to minimize costs associated with transportation, both in terms of fares and taxes. However, improving transit efficiency is also crucial to ensure accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized, as they balance affordability with potential improvements in transit services. Proposals with higher driver fees are also considered to encourage a shift from driving to transit, potentially reducing congestion and improving transit times."
