    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn has a median household income lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents prioritize essential spending, with limited room for discretionary consumption. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for many residents, as car ownership is lower than in other areas. Efficient and affordable transit options are essential for accessing jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, lower transit fares and minimal driver fees are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel time is also important to improve access to employment and services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate taxes that offer better transit times, are preferred."
