    "disposable_income": "Washington Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Due to lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, taxes, and fees.",
    "accessibility": "Washington Park has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, it is crucial to minimize costs while improving transit accessibility. Lower fares and taxes are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it leads to significant improvements in transit times, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected proposals balance these considerations by offering reduced transit times and maintaining or slightly increasing costs, which could be offset by improved service quality."
