    "disposable_income": "The Near North Side is one of the more affluent areas in Chicago, with a higher average disposable income compared to other communities. Residents can generally afford higher costs associated with transportation, but they still value cost-effectiveness.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher disposable income, residents of the Near North Side have significant discretionary spending on dining, entertainment, and luxury goods. They are likely to prioritize policies that do not significantly impact their discretionary consumption.",
    "accessibility": "The Near North Side has excellent accessibility to public transit, with multiple CTA train lines and bus routes. However, traffic congestion can be an issue, making efficient transit options appealing to reduce travel time.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance lower transit fares and reasonable driving fees to encourage public transit use while maintaining efficient travel times. A moderate sales tax is acceptable given the community's income level, as it supports better transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and costs for both transit and driving, while ensuring that the community's discretionary consumption is not heavily impacted."
