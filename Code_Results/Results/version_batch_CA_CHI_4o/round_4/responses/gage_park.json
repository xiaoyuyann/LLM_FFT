    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income below the city average. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Gage Park has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on cars for commuting. Improving transit times could encourage more residents to switch from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and driver fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit service. The goal is to balance affordability with improved accessibility and reduced travel times."
