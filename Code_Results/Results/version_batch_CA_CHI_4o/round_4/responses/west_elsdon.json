    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "West Elsdon has moderate access to public transit, with many residents relying on both driving and transit for commuting. Improving transit times and reducing congestion are important for enhancing accessibility to jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on balancing costs with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing travel times and maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers."
