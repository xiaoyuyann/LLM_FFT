    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side is a diverse area with a mix of income levels, but generally has a higher average income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents have a moderate to high level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Near South Side tend to have higher discretionary spending due to their higher income levels. They are likely to prioritize convenience and quality of life improvements.",
    "accessibility": "The Near South Side has good access to public transportation, including buses and trains, making it relatively easy for residents to commute without a car. However, driving is also common due to the proximity to downtown and major highways.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community can afford slightly higher taxes and fees if it results in better transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on balancing cost with improved accessibility and reduced congestion. Lower transit fares are preferred to encourage public transit use, but a moderate increase in driver fees is acceptable to reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is also acceptable to support transit improvements. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times for both transit and driving while maintaining reasonable costs."
