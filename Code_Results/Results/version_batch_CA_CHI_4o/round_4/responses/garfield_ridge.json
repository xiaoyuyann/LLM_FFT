    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs that could impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Garfield Ridge has moderate access to public transit, with some reliance on driving due to the community's layout and connectivity. Improvements in transit times could encourage more residents to use public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance the budget impact and improve transit service. A lower sales tax is also favored to maintain disposable income for other consumption. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times and costs, encouraging a shift from driving to transit where feasible, while keeping the financial burden manageable."
