    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and professional residents. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some flexibility in spending but with a need to manage costs effectively.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jefferson Park have moderate discretionary spending, with priorities on housing, education, and transportation. The community values affordability and cost-effectiveness in daily expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Jefferson Park has good access to public transportation, including the CTA Blue Line and several bus routes. Car ownership is common, but public transit is a viable option for many residents. Reducing travel time and improving transit services are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary spending, Jefferson Park residents would benefit from lower transit fares and reasonable driver fees to maintain affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel time is a priority, especially for transit users. The community would prefer policies that balance cost with improved accessibility and reduced travel times. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized."
