    "disposable_income": "Burnside is a community with a relatively low median household income compared to the city average. Residents are sensitive to changes in costs related to transportation, as it directly impacts their limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly affect the ability of residents to spend on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Burnside has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting to work and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes minimizing costs for residents while improving transit times. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to maintain affordability. Proposals with moderate driver fees are considered to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The focus is on balancing cost savings with improved transit service, given the community's reliance on public transportation and limited income."
