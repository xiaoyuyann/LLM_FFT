    "disposable_income": "North Center is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a high level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services. Residents may be sensitive to changes in disposable income that affect their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "North Center has good access to public transit, including CTA bus and train lines, making it convenient for residents to use public transportation. However, many residents also own cars and use them for commuting and other travel.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, North Center residents can absorb moderate increases in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better transit services and reduced travel times. The community values efficient transportation options, so proposals that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. A balance between tax rates, fares, and fees is important to ensure that the community can maintain its lifestyle while benefiting from improved transit services. Proposals with lower sales tax rates are preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending, while moderate increases in fares and fees are acceptable if they lead to substantial improvements in travel times."
