    "disposable_income": "Calumet Heights is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Calumet Heights has moderate access to public transit, with some reliance on personal vehicles. Improving transit times and reducing congestion are important, but cost increases must be carefully weighed against the benefits.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance the budget impact and improve transit times. A lower sales tax is also favored to maintain disposable income for other expenses. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times without significantly increasing costs, thus supporting both transit users and drivers in the community."
