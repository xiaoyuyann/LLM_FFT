    "disposable_income": "South Shore has a moderate to low average disposable income, with many residents relying on public transportation for commuting. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary spending is limited, with a significant portion of income allocated to essential expenses. Any increase in transportation costs could impact the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Public transportation is a crucial mode of transport for South Shore residents, providing access to employment, education, and other services. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transit and sensitivity to cost changes, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The community would benefit from a balance between improved transit services and maintaining affordability. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while keeping costs manageable for residents."
