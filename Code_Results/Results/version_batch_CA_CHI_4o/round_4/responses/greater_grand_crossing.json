    "disposable_income": "Greater Grand Crossing has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, leaving less room for discretionary consumption. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "The community has moderate access to public transit, but travel times are longer compared to driving. Improving transit efficiency and affordability is crucial for residents who rely on it.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, proposals with lower transit fares and minimal increases in sales tax are preferred to minimize financial strain. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The tradeoff involves balancing lower costs with improved transit service and accessibility."
