    "disposable_income": "Lake View is a relatively affluent community with a higher than average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can generally afford moderate increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake View have a higher level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services. They are likely to be sensitive to changes in disposable income that affect their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Lake View has good access to public transportation, with several CTA train lines and bus routes. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting, but there is also a significant number of car owners.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and reliance on public transit, Lake View residents would benefit from policies that improve transit service without significantly increasing costs. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Lower transit fares are preferred to encourage public transit use, but a reasonable driving fee is acceptable to reduce congestion and emissions. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering improved transit times and moderate costs."
