    "disposable_income": "The Lower West Side has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of working-class and middle-income households. Many residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for essential and discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Lower West Side allocate a significant portion of their income to essential expenses such as housing and food, with limited room for discretionary spending. Therefore, policies that increase transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The Lower West Side has decent access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, transit times are relatively long compared to driving, which can be a barrier for those who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to prioritize policies that minimize additional financial burdens while improving transit efficiency. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage public transit use, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid significant impacts on overall consumption. Therefore, the top-ranked policies focus on balancing lower costs with improved transit times, considering both transit users and drivers."
