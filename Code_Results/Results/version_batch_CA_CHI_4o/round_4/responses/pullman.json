    "disposable_income": "Pullman is a community with a moderate level of disposable income. Many residents are working-class, and affordability is a key concern when it comes to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels. Residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Pullman has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, and improvements in transit services could enhance accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on public transit, the community would benefit from lower transit fares and moderate driver fees to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a reasonable sales tax, are prioritized. The goal is to balance affordability with improved transit services and reduced travel times."
