    "disposable_income": "Logan Square is a diverse community with a mix of income levels. While there are affluent areas, there are also parts of the community with lower income levels. The median household income is around the city average, which suggests a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Logan Square have a moderate level of discretionary consumption. The area has a vibrant local economy with many small businesses, restaurants, and cultural venues, indicating that residents value spending on leisure and cultural activities.",
    "accessibility": "Logan Square has good access to public transportation, including the Blue Line and several bus routes. However, car ownership is also common, and many residents rely on both modes of transportation. The community values efficient and affordable transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower fare and driving fee would benefit residents who rely on public transportation and those who drive. However, improving transit times is also crucial to encourage more residents to use public transportation, reducing congestion and emissions. Balancing these factors, the preferred policies are those that offer a reasonable fare and driving fee while improving transit times. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents' discretionary spending."
