    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, and any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "East Garfield Park has moderate access to public transit, but travel times are longer compared to driving. Improving transit efficiency and affordability is crucial for residents who rely on it.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, minimizing costs is a priority. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes that also reduce travel times are prioritized. Driver fees are less of a concern as car ownership is lower, but they can help improve transit services by reducing congestion."
