    "disposable_income": "Woodlawn has a moderate to low average disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary spending is limited, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact residents' ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Woodlawn has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could greatly benefit the community, especially for those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income in Woodlawn, policies with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize financial strain. However, improving transit times is also crucial, as many residents rely on public transportation. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' discretionary spending."
