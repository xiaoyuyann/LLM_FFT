    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch is a working-class neighborhood with moderate disposable income levels. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can significantly impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce spending on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Hegewisch has limited public transit options, with residents relying heavily on driving. Improving transit accessibility and reducing travel times could benefit the community, but cost increases must be carefully considered.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on driving, proposals that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with reasonable travel times are prioritized. Lower sales taxes are preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The community would benefit from improved transit services, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are ranked higher. The tradeoff between cost and improved transit times is carefully considered to ensure affordability and accessibility."
