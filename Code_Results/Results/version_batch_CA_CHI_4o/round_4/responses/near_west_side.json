    "disposable_income": "The Near West Side has a diverse population with varying income levels, but generally, it has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to downtown and the presence of professionals and students.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and education being significant due to the area's vibrant cultural scene and educational institutions.",
    "accessibility": "The Near West Side has good accessibility to public transit, with several CTA lines and bus routes. However, traffic congestion can be an issue for drivers, making efficient transit options important.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, a slightly higher sales tax could be acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Lower transit fares are preferred to encourage public transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it leads to reduced travel times and better transit services. The focus is on balancing costs with improved accessibility and reduced travel times."
