    "disposable_income": "Armour Square has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Armour Square have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on essentials like housing and food, but also on leisure and cultural activities. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on these non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Armour Square has decent access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times by transit are relatively long compared to driving, which is a concern for residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and public transit, the goal is to minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to maintain disposable income for other expenditures. The selected proposals aim to balance these factors, prioritizing reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving."
