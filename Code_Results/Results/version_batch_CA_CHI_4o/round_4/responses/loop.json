    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a central business district with a mix of high-income professionals and lower-income service workers. Disposable income varies significantly, but overall, the area has a relatively high average income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Loop have a high level of discretionary consumption due to the presence of numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options. However, the cost of living is also high, which affects disposable income.",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent accessibility to resources and services, with extensive public transit options including buses and trains. Walking and biking are also viable options due to the dense urban environment.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high accessibility to public transit and the importance of maintaining efficient transit services, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable to support transit improvements, but it should not overly burden residents. The focus is on balancing cost with improved transit times and maintaining accessibility."
