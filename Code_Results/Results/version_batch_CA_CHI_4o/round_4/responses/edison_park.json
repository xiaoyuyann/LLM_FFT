    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher disposable income, residents of Edison Park have a higher level of discretionary consumption. They are likely to prioritize convenience and time savings over cost savings in transportation.",
    "accessibility": "Edison Park has limited public transit options compared to more central areas of Chicago. Many residents rely on driving for their daily commutes, making driving time and costs significant factors in policy evaluation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and improve transit efficiency are prioritized. A moderate increase in sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Lower transit fares are less critical due to the community's income level, but reduced driving times and fees are important to maintain convenience and accessibility. Therefore, policies with moderate sales tax, reduced driving times, and reasonable transit times are preferred."
