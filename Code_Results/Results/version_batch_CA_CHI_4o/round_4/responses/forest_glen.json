    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents in Forest Glen likely have higher discretionary spending on goods and services. However, they may still be sensitive to significant increases in costs that could impact their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Forest Glen has good access to public transportation, including Metra and CTA services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting. The community values efficient and reliable transit options to maintain accessibility to the city center and other areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's higher income, a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fare is acceptable if it results in improved transit services and reduced travel times. However, a balance is needed to ensure that costs do not disproportionately impact residents who rely on driving. Proposals that reduce travel time significantly for both transit and driving, while maintaining reasonable costs, are prioritized. The community is willing to support a higher sales tax if it leads to substantial improvements in transit efficiency and accessibility."
