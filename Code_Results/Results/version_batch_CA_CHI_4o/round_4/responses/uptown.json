    "disposable_income": "Uptown has a diverse population with a mix of income levels, including both low-income and middle-income residents. The disposable income varies significantly across the community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Uptown have varied discretionary spending habits, with some focusing on essential goods and services, while others have more flexibility for leisure and non-essential spending.",
    "accessibility": "Uptown is well-served by public transit, including several CTA train lines and bus routes, making it relatively easy for residents to access resources and services without relying heavily on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the diverse income levels in Uptown, it is important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage more residents to use public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to ensure accessibility and affordability for all residents."
