    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has a relatively lower median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are more sensitive to changes in costs related to transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential expenses, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "West Pullman has moderate access to public transit, but travel times are longer compared to driving. Improving transit efficiency and reducing costs could benefit residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower income levels, minimizing costs is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to keep transportation affordable. However, improving transit times is also important to make public transportation a more viable option. A balance between cost and efficiency is needed. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' budgets."
