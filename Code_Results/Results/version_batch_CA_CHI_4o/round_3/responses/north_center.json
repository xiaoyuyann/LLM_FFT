    "disposable_income": "North Center is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher disposable income, residents of North Center tend to have higher discretionary spending on goods and services. However, they are also sensitive to changes in costs that could impact their lifestyle and consumption patterns.",
    "accessibility": "North Center has good access to public transit options, including buses and the Brown Line 'L' train, making it convenient for residents to use public transportation. Car ownership is also common, and driving is a viable option for many.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's higher income and good access to public transit, policies that improve transit service and reduce travel time are prioritized. However, the community is also sensitive to increases in costs that could impact discretionary spending. Therefore, a balance between improving transit service and maintaining reasonable costs is essential. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while a moderate sales tax is acceptable to support transit improvements."
