    "disposable_income": "Woodlawn has a moderate to low average disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary spending is limited, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact residents' ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Woodlawn has access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and reliability could greatly benefit the community. Car ownership is lower than average, so transit improvements are crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to keep transit fares low to ensure affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing car travel times is less critical due to lower car ownership. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized, while driver fees are considered acceptable if they lead to better transit services."
