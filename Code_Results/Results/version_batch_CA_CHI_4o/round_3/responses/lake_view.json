    "disposable_income": "Lake View is a relatively affluent community with a higher than average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can generally afford moderate increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake View have a higher level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services. They are likely to be sensitive to changes in disposable income due to increased transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Lake View has good access to public transportation, with several CTA train lines and bus routes serving the area. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting and daily activities, although car ownership is also common.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and reliance on public transit, Lake View residents would benefit from policies that improve transit service without significantly increasing costs. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Lower transit fares are preferred to encourage public transit use, while moderate driver fees can help reduce congestion and emissions. The selected policies balance these factors, aiming to improve transit times and service quality while maintaining affordability."
