    "disposable_income": "Beverly is a middle to upper-middle-class neighborhood with relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can afford moderate increases in transportation costs but still value cost-effectiveness.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Beverly have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, spending on housing, education, and leisure activities. They are likely to be sensitive to changes in transportation costs that could impact their overall budget.",
    "accessibility": "Beverly has good access to public transportation, including Metra rail services, which are frequently used by residents for commuting. However, many residents also rely on cars for convenience and flexibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Beverly's relatively high disposable income and reliance on both public transit and cars, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The community would prefer policies that reduce travel time for both transit and driving, as time savings are highly valued. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales taxes that offer significant travel time reductions are prioritized."
