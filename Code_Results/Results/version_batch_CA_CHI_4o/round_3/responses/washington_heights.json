    "disposable_income": "Washington Heights has a moderate to low average disposable income, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as fares and fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income going towards essential expenses. Therefore, any increase in transportation costs could impact the ability to spend on other necessary goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Washington Heights has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income and limited discretionary consumption, the community would benefit from lower transit fares and minimal increases in driving fees. However, improving transit times is also crucial. Therefore, proposals that offer a balance between lower costs and improved transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on overall consumption. The top-ranked proposals reflect a preference for lower fares and fees, with some acceptance of moderate sales tax increases if they result in significant improvements in transit times."
