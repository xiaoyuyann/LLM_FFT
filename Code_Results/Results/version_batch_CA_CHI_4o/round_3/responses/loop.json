    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a central business district with a high average income due to the presence of many professionals and businesses. However, there is also a significant population of students and lower-income workers who may be more sensitive to changes in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents and workers in the Loop have a high level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and retail being significant. However, any increase in transportation costs could impact lower-income residents and workers more significantly.",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent accessibility to resources and services via public transit, with multiple train and bus lines. Driving is less common due to congestion and high parking costs, but it remains an option for some.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the need to balance costs for both high and low-income residents, the focus is on maintaining or improving transit service while minimizing fare increases. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. Driver fees are less of a concern due to lower car usage. The selected policies aim to reduce transit times and maintain affordability, especially for lower-income residents, while ensuring sufficient funding for transit improvements."
