    "disposable_income": "The Near West Side has a diverse population with varying income levels, but generally, it has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to downtown and the presence of professionals and students.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and education being significant due to the area's vibrant cultural scene and educational institutions.",
    "accessibility": "The Near West Side has good accessibility to resources and services, with multiple transit options including buses and trains, and is also bike-friendly. However, traffic congestion can be an issue for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, a slightly higher sales tax could be acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Lower transit fares are preferred to encourage public transport use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate driver fee is acceptable to further incentivize transit use. The focus is on balancing cost with improved transit efficiency and reduced travel times. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized, as they offer a good balance of affordability and service improvement."
