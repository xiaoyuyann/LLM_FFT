    "disposable_income": "Brighton Park is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income below the city average. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through taxes, fares, or fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower median income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Brighton Park has moderate access to public transit, with several bus lines and a nearby CTA Orange Line station. However, transit times are relatively long, and many residents rely on driving for faster commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. Proposals that reduce car travel time are also favored, as many residents drive. The goal is to balance affordability with improved transit service, encouraging a shift from driving to transit where feasible."
