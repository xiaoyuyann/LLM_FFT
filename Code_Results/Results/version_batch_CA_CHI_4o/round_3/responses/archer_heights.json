    "disposable_income": "Archer Heights is a middle-income community with a significant portion of residents working in blue-collar jobs. The disposable income is moderate, and residents are sensitive to increases in living costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Archer Heights have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Archer Heights has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the nature of their jobs and the need for flexibility. Reducing travel time and costs is important for both modes of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both transit and driving, the community would benefit from policies that balance lower costs with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use while not overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between cost savings and improved accessibility, with a preference for lower fares and moderate driver fees to reduce congestion and improve transit times."
