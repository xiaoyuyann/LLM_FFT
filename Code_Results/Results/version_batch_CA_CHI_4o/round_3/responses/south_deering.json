    "disposable_income": "South Deering has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "South Deering has limited access to public transit options, making it crucial to improve transit services without significantly increasing costs. Many residents rely on driving due to the lack of efficient public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income and limited transit options, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and driver fees are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The selected proposals aim to balance cost savings with improved transit times, encouraging a shift from driving to transit where feasible."
