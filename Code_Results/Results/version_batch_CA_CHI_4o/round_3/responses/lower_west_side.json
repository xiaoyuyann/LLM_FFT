    "disposable_income": "The Lower West Side has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of working-class and middle-income households. Many residents rely on public transportation due to the cost-effectiveness compared to owning and maintaining a car.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary spending is moderate, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "The Lower West Side has decent access to public transportation, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times can be long, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transportation and moderate income levels, the priority is to minimize fare increases while improving transit efficiency. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Driver fees are acceptable if they lead to reduced congestion and better transit services. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering lower fares and moderate driver fees, with a focus on reducing travel times."
