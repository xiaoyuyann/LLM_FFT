    "disposable_income": "Auburn Gresham has a median household income lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, discretionary spending is constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Auburn Gresham has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could enhance accessibility. Many residents rely on public transit, so fare reductions and improved service are crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit service. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to balance affordability and service quality. Driver fees are less impactful as car ownership is lower, but they can help reduce congestion and improve transit times. The selected proposals aim to reduce transit costs, improve service times, and maintain a reasonable tax burden."
