    "disposable_income": "Dunning is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but they can absorb moderate increases if they lead to significant improvements in service.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities. Residents are likely to prioritize transportation costs that do not significantly impact their overall budget.",
    "accessibility": "Dunning has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit options are available but could be improved. Many residents rely on driving, but there is potential for increased transit use if services are enhanced.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on balancing costs with improvements in service. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The goal is to reduce travel times and improve accessibility while maintaining affordability."
