    "disposable_income": "The East Side community has a moderate to low average disposable income, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as fares and fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, discretionary consumption is limited. Residents prioritize essential expenses, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The East Side has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but travel times are relatively long, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes minimizing costs for residents while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to balance cost savings with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and sensitivity to cost increases."
