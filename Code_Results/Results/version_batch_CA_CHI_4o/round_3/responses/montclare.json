    "disposable_income": "Montclare is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and non-essential goods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, food, and transportation being significant. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce spending in other areas.",
    "accessibility": "Montclare has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit options are available but not as extensive as in more central areas. Many residents rely on driving for convenience and time efficiency.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost and efficiency. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to improved transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and maintaining affordability. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized, as they offer a good balance between cost savings and improved transit efficiency."
