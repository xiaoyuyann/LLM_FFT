    "disposable_income": "Belmont Cragin is a middle-income community with a significant portion of residents working in blue-collar jobs. The community has a moderate level of disposable income, which means that any increase in transportation costs could impact their budget for other essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Belmont Cragin have limited discretionary spending due to their income levels. They prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Belmont Cragin has moderate access to public transit, with some residents relying on buses and trains to commute to work. Car ownership is also common, but traffic congestion can be an issue. Improving transit times and reducing congestion would benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to keep costs low while improving transit services. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage more people to use public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while ensuring that the community can still afford other essential expenses."
