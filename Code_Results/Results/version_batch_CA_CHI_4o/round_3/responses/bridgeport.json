    "accessibility": "Bridgeport has decent access to public transportation, with several bus lines and proximity to the CTA Red Line. However, driving is also common due to the community's location and the need for flexibility in commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, the community would benefit from lower transit fares and minimal increases in sales tax and driving fees. The focus is on maintaining affordability while improving transit efficiency. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driving fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while keeping costs manageable for residents. The selected proposals balance the need for improved transit services with the community's financial constraints."
