    "disposable_income": "Calumet Heights is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Calumet Heights has moderate access to public transit, with some reliance on driving due to the layout and connectivity of the area. Improving transit times and reducing congestion are important for enhancing accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance the budget impact and improve transit services. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit service. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and moderate driver fees to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while maintaining a reasonable sales tax to support transit improvements."
