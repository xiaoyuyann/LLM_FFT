    "disposable_income": "West Lawn is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to increases in transportation costs, but they also value improvements in transit services.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "West Lawn has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is used by a significant portion of the community, but many residents also rely on driving. Improvements in transit times could benefit the community, but not at a high cost.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision focuses on balancing the cost of transportation with the benefits of improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability while reducing travel times. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The community prioritizes proposals that offer reduced travel times for both transit and driving without significantly increasing costs."
