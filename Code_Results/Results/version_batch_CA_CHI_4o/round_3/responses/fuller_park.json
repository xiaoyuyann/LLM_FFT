    "disposable_income": "Fuller Park is one of the lower-income areas in Chicago, with a median household income significantly below the city average. Residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Fuller Park has limited access to public transportation options, and many residents rely on driving. Improving transit accessibility and reducing travel times could benefit the community, but affordability remains a key concern.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the low disposable income and limited discretionary spending, policies with lower fares and taxes are prioritized to minimize financial burden. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower costs and improved transit times are preferred. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel times, as it could encourage a shift to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
