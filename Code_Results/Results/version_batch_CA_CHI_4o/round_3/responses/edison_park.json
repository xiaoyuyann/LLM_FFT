    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services. Residents may be sensitive to changes in disposable income that affect their ability to maintain their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Edison Park has good access to public transportation, including Metra rail services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting. The community values efficient and reliable transit options, but also benefits from reduced congestion and improved driving conditions.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, Edison Park can absorb moderate increases in transit fares and driver fees if they lead to significant improvements in transit service and reduced congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary consumption. The community values reduced travel times for both transit and driving, so proposals that achieve this balance are prioritized. The top-ranked proposals reflect a preference for moderate fare and fee increases that lead to improved transit times and reduced driving times, while keeping the sales tax at a manageable level."
