    "disposable_income": "Roseland has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Roseland has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit service could greatly benefit residents who rely on it. However, the community also has a significant number of car owners who would be affected by driver fees.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the economic constraints of Roseland residents, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit accessibility. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it leads to significant improvements in transit times, as this could encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The selected proposals balance these considerations by offering lower fares and moderate driver fees, with a focus on reducing transit times to improve accessibility."
