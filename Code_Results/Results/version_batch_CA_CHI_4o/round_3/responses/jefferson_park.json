    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and professional residents. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some flexibility in spending but with a need to manage costs effectively.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jefferson Park have moderate discretionary spending, with priorities on housing, education, and transportation. The community values affordability and cost-effectiveness in daily expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Jefferson Park has good access to public transportation, including the CTA Blue Line and Metra, making transit a viable option for many residents. However, driving is also common due to the community's suburban characteristics and proximity to major highways.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary spending, Jefferson Park residents would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage public transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The community values reduced travel times and cost-effective transportation options. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, coupled with reasonable sales taxes, are prioritized. The goal is to enhance transit accessibility while maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers."
