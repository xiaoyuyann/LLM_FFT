    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents in Forest Glen likely have higher discretionary spending on goods and services. However, they may still be sensitive to significant increases in costs that could impact their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Forest Glen has good access to public transportation, including Metra and CTA services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting. The community values efficient and reliable transit options to maintain accessibility to the rest of the city.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision-making process involves balancing the need for efficient transportation with the cost implications for residents. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use while maintaining affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel time is also a priority, as it enhances accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals that offer a good balance of lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable travel times are prioritized. High sales taxes are less favored due to their impact on discretionary spending."
