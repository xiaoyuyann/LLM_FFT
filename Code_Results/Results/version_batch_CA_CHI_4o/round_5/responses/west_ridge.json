    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households. The community is diverse, with a significant portion of residents relying on public transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in West Ridge have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services. The community values affordability in transportation to maintain their current consumption levels.",
    "accessibility": "West Ridge has decent access to public transportation, with several bus routes and proximity to the CTA Red Line. However, travel times can be long, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on public transportation, West Ridge would benefit from policies that reduce transit fares and improve travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The community would also benefit from reduced congestion and emissions, so a moderate driver fee is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable travel times, while keeping the sales tax at a manageable level."
