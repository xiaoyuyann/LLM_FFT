    "disposable_income": "Mount Greenwood is a middle-class community with a relatively stable disposable income. Residents have a moderate capacity to absorb additional costs from taxes or fees, but significant increases could impact their discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, education, and local services. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce spending in these areas.",
    "accessibility": "Mount Greenwood has moderate access to public transit, with many residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting. Improvements in transit times could encourage more residents to use public transportation, but the community is sensitive to increases in driving fees.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on personal vehicles and moderate use of public transit, the focus is on balancing costs with improvements in transit times. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to minimize the impact on disposable income while still supporting transit improvements. Proposals with lower driving fees are favored to avoid burdening car-dependent residents. The selected proposals aim to improve transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents."
