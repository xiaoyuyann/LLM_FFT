    "disposable_income": "Norwood Park is a middle to upper-middle-income community with a relatively high level of disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Norwood Park have moderate to high discretionary spending, with a focus on housing, education, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Norwood Park has good access to public transportation, including Metra and CTA services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting due to the suburban nature of the area.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The community values reduced travel times for both transit and driving, as many residents commute to work. Therefore, proposals that balance lower fares and fees with improved travel times are prioritized. The top choices reflect a preference for maintaining or slightly reducing current costs while improving transit efficiency and reducing driving times."
