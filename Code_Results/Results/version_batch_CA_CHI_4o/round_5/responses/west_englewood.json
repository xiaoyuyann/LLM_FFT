    "disposable_income": "West Englewood has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Due to lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are likely to prioritize essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in West Englewood, as car ownership is lower than in other areas. Accessibility to jobs, education, and healthcare via transit is vital.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve discretionary spending. However, improving transit times is important for accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate tax rates, and improved transit times are prioritized. The tradeoff involves balancing cost savings with the need for efficient transit services."
