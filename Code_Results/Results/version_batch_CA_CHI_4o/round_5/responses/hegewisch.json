    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch is a working-class neighborhood with moderate disposable income levels. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can significantly impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce spending on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Hegewisch has limited public transit options, with residents relying heavily on driving. Improving transit services could enhance accessibility, but cost increases must be balanced with affordability.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on driving, the community would benefit from policies that reduce travel time and costs without significantly increasing taxes or fares. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. However, the community is sensitive to tax increases, so a balance must be struck between improving transit services and maintaining affordability. The selected policies prioritize lower fares and moderate driver fees to improve transit accessibility while minimizing the financial burden on residents."
