    "accessibility": "Hermosa has moderate access to public transit, with some reliance on driving. Improving transit times could benefit residents, but cost increases must be carefully balanced.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision focuses on minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and taxes are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. Proposals with moderate driver fees are considered to encourage a shift to transit, potentially reducing congestion and emissions. The goal is to find a balance between affordability and improved transit service."
