    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services. Residents may be sensitive to changes in disposable income that affect their ability to maintain their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Edison Park has good access to public transportation, including Metra and CTA bus services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting. The community values efficient and reliable transit options to maintain accessibility to the broader Chicago area.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, Edison Park can absorb moderate increases in transit fares and driver fees if they result in improved transit services and reduced travel times. The community prioritizes policies that balance cost with significant improvements in transit efficiency and reduced congestion. Lower sales tax rates are preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and driver fees, coupled with lower sales taxes, are favored. The top-ranked proposals offer a good balance of reduced travel times and reasonable costs, enhancing overall accessibility without significantly impacting discretionary consumption."
