    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The disposable income is moderate, meaning residents are sensitive to increases in costs that could affect their budget for essential and discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Morgan Park have moderate discretionary spending. They prioritize essential goods and services but also value affordable transportation options to access employment, education, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park has access to public transit, but travel times are relatively long compared to driving. Improving transit efficiency and affordability is important to the community, as many residents rely on public transportation for daily commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and the need for efficient and affordable transit, the community would benefit from policies that reduce transit fares and improve travel times without significantly increasing the sales tax or driving fees. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The community is likely to favor policies that balance cost savings with improved transit services, while minimizing the impact on discretionary spending."
