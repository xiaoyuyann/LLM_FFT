    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side is a diverse area with a mix of income levels, but generally has a higher average income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents may have more disposable income to allocate towards transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher average income, residents likely have a higher level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The Near South Side has good access to public transportation, including buses and trains, making it convenient for residents to use transit. However, driving is also common due to proximity to major highways.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision focuses on balancing the cost of transportation with the benefits of reduced travel time and improved transit services. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to maintain disposable income for discretionary spending. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel time and congestion. The community values efficient transit options and is willing to support policies that enhance transit services, even if it means a slight increase in costs. Therefore, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, but higher driver fees that lead to reduced travel times, are prioritized."
