    "disposable_income": "West Town is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, but generally has a moderate to high disposable income due to its gentrification and proximity to downtown Chicago.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in West Town tend to have higher discretionary spending on dining, entertainment, and retail, reflecting the area's vibrant cultural and social scene.",
    "accessibility": "West Town has good access to public transit, including buses and the 'L' train, and is also bike-friendly. However, traffic congestion can be an issue for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares or driver fees if it results in better service and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The community values efficient transit options to reduce reliance on cars and alleviate congestion. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which improve transit times, are prioritized. The tradeoff involves balancing the cost of transit improvements with maintaining disposable income for other expenditures."
