    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn has a median household income that is lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Chicago Lawn have limited discretionary spending due to lower income levels, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget for other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago Lawn has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to prioritize policies that minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it leads to significant reductions in transit times, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit service, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and limited financial flexibility."
