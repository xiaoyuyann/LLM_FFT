    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for New City residents, with many relying on it for commuting to work and accessing services. Car ownership is lower than average, making affordable and efficient transit options vital.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. A balance between affordable transit fares and reasonable sales tax rates is crucial to ensure that residents can maintain their essential consumption while benefiting from improved transit services. Proposals with higher driver fees are considered to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions, which aligns with the community's reliance on public transit."
