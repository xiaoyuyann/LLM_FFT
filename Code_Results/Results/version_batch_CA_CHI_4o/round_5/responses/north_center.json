    "disposable_income": "North Center is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a high level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services being common. This suggests that residents may be sensitive to increases in costs that could impact their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "North Center has good access to public transit, with several CTA bus routes and the Brown Line serving the area. Car ownership is also common, and the community benefits from relatively short travel times to downtown Chicago and other key areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's higher income and discretionary spending, a moderate increase in transit fare and driver fees could be acceptable if it results in improved transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The focus is on balancing cost with improved service and reduced travel times, particularly for transit, which is well-utilized in the area. Proposals with a $0.75 fare and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use while maintaining affordability. A 1% sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit service."
