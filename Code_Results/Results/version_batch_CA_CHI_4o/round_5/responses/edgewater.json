    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Edgewater have moderate discretionary spending. The community has a variety of local businesses, restaurants, and cultural activities that residents enjoy.

    "accessibility": "Edgewater has good access to public transportation, including several CTA train lines and bus routes. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting to work and accessing services. Car ownership is moderate, with some residents preferring to drive for convenience.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies that reduce transit fares and improve service are prioritized.
