    "disposable_income": "Beverly is a middle to upper-middle-class neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can afford moderate increases in transportation costs but still value cost-effectiveness.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Beverly have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods. They are likely to be sensitive to changes in disposable income due to increased transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Beverly has good access to public transportation, including Metra rail services, which are frequently used by residents for commuting. However, many residents also rely on cars for convenience and flexibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Beverly's relatively high disposable income, residents can absorb some increase in transportation costs, but they value efficient and cost-effective transit options. A balance between lower fares and moderate taxes is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Proposals that reduce travel time significantly are prioritized, as they enhance convenience and quality of life. The community is likely to support policies that improve transit services without drastically increasing costs. Therefore, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, and reasonable driving fees that reduce congestion and travel time, are favored."
