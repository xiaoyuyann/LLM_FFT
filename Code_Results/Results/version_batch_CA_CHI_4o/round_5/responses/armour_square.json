    "disposable_income": "Armour Square has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and non-essential goods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Armour Square have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on essentials like housing and food, but also on leisure and cultural activities. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on these discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "Armour Square has decent access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times by transit are relatively long compared to driving, which is a concern for residents who rely on public transportation for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and the need to maintain discretionary spending, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred. Reducing travel time is also a priority to improve accessibility. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on overall consumption. Therefore, proposals that balance lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable travel times are prioritized. The community is willing to accept a slightly higher sales tax if it significantly improves transit times and reduces congestion."
