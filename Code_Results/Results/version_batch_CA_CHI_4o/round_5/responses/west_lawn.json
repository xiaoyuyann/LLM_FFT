    "disposable_income": "West Lawn is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "West Lawn has moderate accessibility to public transit, with some reliance on driving due to the layout and availability of transit options. Reducing travel time and improving transit services are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance the budget impact and improve transit times. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel time, maintain affordability, and improve overall transit service quality."
