    "disposable_income": "The Near North Side is one of the wealthier areas in Chicago, with a higher average disposable income compared to other communities. Residents can generally afford higher transportation costs, but they also value efficient and convenient transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents of the Near North Side have a high level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and luxury goods. They are likely to prioritize policies that minimize disruptions to their lifestyle and maintain or improve their quality of life.",
    "accessibility": "The Near North Side has excellent access to public transportation, with multiple transit lines and bus routes. However, traffic congestion can be an issue, so policies that reduce driving times and improve transit efficiency are beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community can handle moderate increases in taxes and fees if they lead to significant improvements in transit efficiency and reduced congestion. Policies that balance lower transit fares with moderate driver fees and taxes are preferred, as they encourage transit use while maintaining revenue for service improvements. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is a priority to enhance accessibility and convenience."
