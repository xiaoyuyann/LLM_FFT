    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in Grand Boulevard, as car ownership is lower than the city average. Therefore, policies that improve transit accessibility and reduce travel time are highly beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the economic constraints and reliance on public transit in Grand Boulevard, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to keep transportation affordable. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel time and congestion, benefiting transit users. The selected policies balance these factors by offering reduced transit fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit service without imposing a high financial burden on residents."
