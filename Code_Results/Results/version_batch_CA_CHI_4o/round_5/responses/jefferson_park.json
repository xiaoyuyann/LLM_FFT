    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some discretionary spending but with sensitivity to increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jefferson Park have moderate discretionary consumption, with spending on housing, food, and transportation being significant. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Jefferson Park has good access to public transit, including the CTA Blue Line and Metra, making it a transit-friendly area. However, many residents also rely on cars for commuting, so both transit and driving options are important.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both transit and driving, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost and service improvements. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers."
