    "disposable_income": "McKinley Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The disposable income is moderate, and residents are sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, and any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "McKinley Park has decent access to public transit, with several bus routes and a nearby CTA Orange Line station. However, many residents also rely on driving for convenience and access to areas not well-served by transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and sensitivity to cost increases, proposals with lower fares and taxes are preferred. However, improving transit times is also important to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, and a reasonable driving fee to improve transit times, are prioritized. The community values both affordability and efficiency in transportation."
