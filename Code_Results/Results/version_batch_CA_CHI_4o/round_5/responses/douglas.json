    "disposable_income": "Douglas has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as a significant portion of income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption in Douglas is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact the ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Douglas has decent access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times by transit are relatively long compared to driving, which can be a barrier for residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary consumption, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred. Additionally, improving transit travel times is crucial to enhance accessibility. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and reasonable costs, while also considering the impact of sales tax on overall expenses. Proposals with a 0.5% sales tax are favored to minimize the impact on disposable income, while still supporting transit improvements."
