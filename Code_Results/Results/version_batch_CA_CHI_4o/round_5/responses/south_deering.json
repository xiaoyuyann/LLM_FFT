    "disposable_income": "South Deering has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "South Deering has limited access to public transit options, making it crucial to improve transit services without significantly increasing costs. Many residents rely on driving due to the lack of efficient public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income and limited transit options, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, which are crucial for the community's economic well-being."
