    "disposable_income": "Chatham has a moderate level of disposable income, with many residents working in middle-income jobs. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as a significant portion of income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption in Chatham is moderate, with residents spending on essentials and some discretionary items. Any increase in transportation costs could impact the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Chatham has decent access to public transit, but travel times are relatively long. Improving transit efficiency and reducing travel times would benefit the community. Car ownership is moderate, and reducing driving times could also be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, Chatham would benefit from policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees to improve transit services without significantly increasing costs. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is crucial. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on disposable income. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized."
