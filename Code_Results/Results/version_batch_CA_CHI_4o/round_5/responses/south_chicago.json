    "disposable_income": "South Chicago has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, and any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "South Chicago has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower income levels, minimizing costs while improving transit times is crucial. A lower fare and driver fee are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected proposals aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on public transit and sensitivity to cost increases."
