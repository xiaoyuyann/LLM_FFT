    "disposable_income": "Brighton Park is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income below the city average. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through taxes, fares, or fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower median income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Brighton Park has moderate access to public transit, with several bus lines and a nearby train station. However, transit times are relatively long, and many residents rely on driving for quicker commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision focuses on minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and taxes are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. Proposals that significantly reduce transit times are favored, as they improve accessibility and quality of life. The tradeoff between slightly higher driver fees and reduced congestion is considered beneficial, as it may encourage a shift to public transit, improving overall efficiency."
