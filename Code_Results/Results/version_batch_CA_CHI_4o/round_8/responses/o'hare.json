    "disposable_income": "O'Hare is a middle-income community with a mix of residential and commercial areas. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some flexibility in spending but with a need to manage costs effectively.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in O'Hare have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services. The community values cost-effective transportation options to maintain their standard of living.",
    "accessibility": "O'Hare has good access to public transportation, including the Blue Line and bus services, but also relies heavily on car travel due to its proximity to the airport and major highways. Reducing travel time and cost is important for both modes of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and the need for cost-effective transportation, the community would benefit from lower transit fares and reasonable driver fees to encourage public transit use while maintaining affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and costs for both transit and driving, while ensuring that the community can still afford other essential goods and services. The selected proposals balance these needs by offering reduced travel times and costs, with a preference for lower fares and moderate driver fees to encourage a shift from driving to transit, thus reducing congestion and emissions."
