    "disposable_income": "Avondale is a diverse community with a mix of income levels. The median household income is moderate, suggesting that residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Avondale have a moderate level of discretionary spending. They are likely to be affected by increases in transit fares and driving fees, as these would reduce their disposable income for other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Avondale has good access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, driving is also a common mode of transportation for many residents. Reducing travel time and improving transit services would be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and the importance of both transit and driving in Avondale, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost and service improvements. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and maintaining affordability."
