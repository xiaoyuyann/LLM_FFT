    "disposable_income": "The Near West Side has a diverse population with varying income levels, but generally, it has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to downtown and the presence of professionals and students.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Near West Side have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and retail being significant due to the area's vibrant lifestyle and amenities.",
    "accessibility": "The Near West Side has good accessibility to resources and services, with multiple transit options including buses and trains, as well as proximity to major highways for drivers. However, transit times can be long, and congestion is a concern for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing transit times is crucial, as many residents rely on public transportation. A moderate fare and driver fee balance the need for revenue with affordability. The community would benefit from reduced congestion and emissions, so policies that encourage transit use over driving are preferred. Therefore, proposals with a moderate fare, moderate driver fee, and a slightly higher sales tax are prioritized to improve transit times and services while maintaining affordability."
