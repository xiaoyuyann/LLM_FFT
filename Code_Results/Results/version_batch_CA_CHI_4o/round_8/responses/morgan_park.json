    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income households. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but there is some flexibility to absorb minor increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, education, and leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs could impact these areas.",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban nature of the area. Reducing travel time and improving transit services are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that reduce travel time without significantly increasing costs. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A balanced approach with a moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reduced travel times and reasonable costs, considering the community's income and consumption patterns."
