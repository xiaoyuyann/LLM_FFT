    "disposable_income": "Chatham has a moderate level of disposable income, with many residents working in middle-income jobs. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as a significant portion of income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption in Chatham is moderate, with residents spending on essentials and some discretionary items. Any increase in transportation costs could impact the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Chatham has decent access to public transit, but travel times are relatively long compared to driving. Improving transit efficiency and reducing travel times could benefit the community, especially for those who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, Chatham would benefit from policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. Reducing travel times is also a priority to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services."
