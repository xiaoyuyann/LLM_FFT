    "disposable_income": "Lake View is a relatively affluent community with a higher than average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can generally afford moderate increases in transportation costs without significant impact on their overall financial well-being.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake View have a high level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and other leisure activities. They value convenience and time savings, which influences their transportation choices.",
    "accessibility": "Lake View has good accessibility to public transit, with multiple CTA train lines and bus routes. However, traffic congestion can be an issue, making efficient transit options appealing to reduce travel time.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, Lake View residents are likely to prioritize policies that improve transit efficiency and reduce travel time, even if it means slightly higher costs. The community values time savings and convenience, so proposals that significantly reduce travel time for both transit and driving are preferred. A moderate increase in sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower transit fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales tax rates that result in reduced travel times are prioritized."
