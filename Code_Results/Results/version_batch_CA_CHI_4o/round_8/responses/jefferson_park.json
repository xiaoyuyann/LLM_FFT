    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some discretionary spending but with sensitivity to increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jefferson Park have moderate discretionary consumption. They prioritize essential goods and services but also spend on leisure and non-essential items. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Jefferson Park has good access to public transportation, including the CTA Blue Line and several bus routes. Car ownership is also common, and many residents commute by car. Accessibility to resources and services is relatively high by both transit and driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, Jefferson Park residents would prefer policies that minimize additional costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and costs for both transit and driving, balancing affordability and service improvement."
