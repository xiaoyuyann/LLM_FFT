    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income below the city average. Residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "Gage Park has moderate access to public transit, with several bus routes and a nearby train station. However, transit times are relatively long, and many residents rely on driving for convenience.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents. The goal is to reduce travel times and costs while maintaining accessibility and minimizing financial strain."
