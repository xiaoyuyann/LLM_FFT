    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as a significant portion of income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Bridgeport have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Bridgeport has decent access to public transportation, with several bus lines and proximity to the CTA Red Line. However, driving is also common due to the community's location and the need for flexibility in commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, the community would benefit from lower transit fares and minimal increases in sales tax. Reducing travel time is also important to improve quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use while maintaining affordability. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial to ensure accessibility without overburdening residents financially."
