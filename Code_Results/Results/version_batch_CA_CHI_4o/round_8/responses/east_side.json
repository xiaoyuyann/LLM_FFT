    "disposable_income": "The East Side community has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs. This means that any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "The East Side has limited access to public transportation, making it more reliant on cars. However, improving transit services could benefit the community by providing more affordable and efficient travel options.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision focuses on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to keep costs manageable for residents while encouraging a shift from driving to transit. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times and costs, making transit a more attractive option while considering the community's financial constraints."
