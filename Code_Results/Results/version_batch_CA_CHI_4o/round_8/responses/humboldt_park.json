    "disposable_income": "Humboldt Park has a moderate to low average disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact residents' ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Humboldt Park has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and reliability could greatly benefit the community. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep transit fares low to ensure affordability. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility and reduce travel time. Balancing these factors, the community would benefit from proposals that offer reduced transit fares and moderate driver fees to encourage a shift from driving to transit, thus reducing congestion and emissions. The selected proposals aim to strike a balance between affordability and improved transit service."
