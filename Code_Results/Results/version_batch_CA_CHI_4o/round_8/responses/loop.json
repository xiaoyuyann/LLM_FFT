    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a central business district with a mix of high-income professionals and lower-income service workers. Disposable income varies significantly, but overall, the area has a relatively high average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Loop have a high level of discretionary consumption due to the presence of numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options. However, the cost of living is also high, which affects the overall discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent accessibility to resources and services via public transit, with multiple train and bus lines. Car ownership is lower than in other areas due to the availability of public transit and the high cost of parking.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high accessibility to public transit and the mixed income levels, the Loop community would benefit from policies that enhance transit services while keeping costs manageable. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage more people to use public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable given the higher disposable income, as it supports better transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers."
