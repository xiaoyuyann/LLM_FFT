    "disposable_income": "Edgewater is a diverse community with a mix of income levels. The median household income is moderate, with a significant portion of residents relying on public transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Edgewater have moderate discretionary spending. They prioritize essential goods and services, with some spending on leisure and dining.",
    "accessibility": "Edgewater has good access to public transportation, including buses and the Red Line, making transit a viable option for many residents. Car ownership is moderate, and traffic congestion can be an issue during peak hours.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Edgewater's reliance on public transportation and moderate income levels, policies that reduce transit fares and improve service are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Moderate driver fees are acceptable if they significantly reduce congestion and improve transit times. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales tax rates, ensuring improved transit services without overly burdening residents financially."
