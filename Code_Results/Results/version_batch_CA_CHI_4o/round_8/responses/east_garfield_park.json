    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, leaving less room for discretionary consumption. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "East Garfield Park has moderate access to public transit, but travel times are longer compared to driving. Improving transit efficiency and affordability is crucial for residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, minimizing costs for residents is a priority. Lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to reduce the financial burden. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. A balance between cost and efficiency is sought. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary consumption."
