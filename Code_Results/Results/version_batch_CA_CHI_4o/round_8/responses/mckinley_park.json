    "disposable_income": "McKinley Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The disposable income is moderate, and residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in McKinley Park have moderate discretionary spending. They prioritize essential goods and services, and any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "McKinley Park has decent access to public transit, with several bus routes and a nearby CTA Orange Line station. However, many residents also rely on driving for convenience and flexibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares, sales tax, and driving fees. Lower transit fares and moderate sales tax rates are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Additionally, reducing driving times and encouraging transit use can improve accessibility and reduce congestion. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driving fees are prioritized, while ensuring that the sales tax does not excessively impact discretionary spending."
