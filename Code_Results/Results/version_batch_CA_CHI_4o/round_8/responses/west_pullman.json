    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has a lower median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are more sensitive to changes in costs related to transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "West Pullman has moderate access to public transit, but travel times are relatively long. Improving transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower income levels, minimizing costs is crucial. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and taxes are preferred. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, but significant improvements in transit times, are prioritized. The community would benefit from reduced travel times, even if it means a slight increase in costs, as long as these costs remain manageable."
