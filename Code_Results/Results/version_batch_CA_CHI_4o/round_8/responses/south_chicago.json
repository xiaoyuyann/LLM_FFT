    "disposable_income": "South Chicago has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "South Chicago has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower income levels, minimizing costs while improving transit times is crucial. A lower fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also offer improved transit times, are prioritized. The tradeoff involves balancing the need for better transit services with the community's ability to afford increased costs."
