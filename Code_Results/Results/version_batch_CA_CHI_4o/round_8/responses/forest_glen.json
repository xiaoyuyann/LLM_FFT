    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents in Forest Glen likely have higher discretionary spending on goods and services. However, they may still be sensitive to significant increases in costs that could impact their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Forest Glen has good access to public transportation, including Metra and CTA services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting. The community values efficient and reliable transit options to maintain accessibility to the broader Chicago area.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's higher income, a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fare is acceptable if it leads to improved transit services and reduced travel times. However, the community is likely to prefer policies that balance cost with tangible benefits in travel efficiency. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it significantly reduces congestion and travel times. The top-ranked proposals reflect a preference for policies that enhance transit efficiency while maintaining reasonable costs, considering both transit users and drivers."
