    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a moderate level of disposable income, with a diverse population including middle-income families and a significant number of low-income households. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs that could impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in West Ridge have a moderate level of discretionary consumption. They prioritize essential goods and services, and any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "West Ridge has decent access to public transit, with several bus routes and proximity to the CTA Red Line. However, travel times by transit are relatively long compared to driving, which is a concern for residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, West Ridge residents would benefit from lower transit fares and minimal increases in sales tax and driving fees. The community values improved transit services to reduce travel times, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred, as they balance cost savings with potential improvements in transit service. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, while keeping costs manageable for residents."
