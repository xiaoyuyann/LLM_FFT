    "disposable_income": "The Near North Side is one of the more affluent areas in Chicago, with a higher average disposable income compared to other communities. Residents can generally afford higher costs associated with transportation, but they still value cost-effectiveness.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Near North Side have a high level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and luxury goods. They are likely to be sensitive to changes in disposable income that affect their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "The Near North Side has excellent access to public transit, with multiple CTA train lines and bus routes. Driving is also common, but congestion can be an issue. Residents value efficient and reliable transit options to maintain their mobility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community can handle moderate increases in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better service and reduced congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit service, which aligns with the community's preference for convenience and efficiency. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and driver fees, combined with lower sales taxes, are prioritized. The top choices reflect a balance between cost and improved service, with an emphasis on reducing travel time for both transit and driving."
