    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch is a working-class neighborhood with moderate disposable income levels. Residents are sensitive to increases in transportation costs, as these can significantly impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce spending on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Hegewisch has limited public transit options, with residents relying heavily on driving. Improving transit times and reducing congestion are important, but cost increases must be balanced with accessibility improvements.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on driving, proposals that significantly increase costs are less favorable. The community would benefit from reduced travel times and improved transit services, but not at the expense of high fares or taxes. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized, as they offer a balance between cost and improved service. The focus is on minimizing the financial burden while enhancing transit efficiency and reducing congestion."
