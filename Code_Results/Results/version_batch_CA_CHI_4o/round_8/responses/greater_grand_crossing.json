    "disposable_income": "Greater Grand Crossing has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, leaving less room for discretionary consumption. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate access to public transit, but travel times are longer compared to driving. Improving transit efficiency and affordability is crucial for residents who rely on it.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, lower transit fares and minimal sales tax are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance cost and service improvement. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to enhance transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for residents."
