    "disposable_income": "Clearing is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but they can absorb moderate increases if they lead to significant improvements in service.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, food, and transportation being significant. Any increase in transportation costs should be justified by tangible benefits in service or time savings.",
    "accessibility": "Clearing has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit options are available but not as efficient as driving. Improvements in transit times could encourage more residents to use public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and balanced consumption, proposals that offer significant improvements in transit times without drastically increasing costs are preferred. A lower sales tax is favored to maintain disposable income for other needs. Proposals with moderate driver fees are acceptable if they lead to reduced congestion and better transit service. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering improved transit times and moderate costs, ensuring that residents can benefit from better services without a significant financial burden."
