    "disposable_income": "Austin is a community with a median household income lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Austin has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could enhance accessibility. Many residents rely on public transit, so fare reductions and improved service are crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes minimizing costs for residents while improving transit accessibility. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals balance these factors, aiming to improve transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents."
