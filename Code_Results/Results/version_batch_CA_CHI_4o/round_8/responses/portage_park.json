    "disposable_income": "Portage Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on housing, food, and leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on these areas.",
    "accessibility": "Portage Park has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the convenience and time savings. Improving transit times could encourage more residents to switch from driving to public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both driving and transit, the goal is to find a balance between affordable transit fares, reasonable driving fees, and a manageable sales tax. Lower fares and fees are preferred to maintain disposable income, but some increase in fees is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times while keeping costs manageable for residents."
