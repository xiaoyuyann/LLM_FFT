    "disposable_income": "Burnside is a community with a relatively low median household income compared to the city average. This means that residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Burnside has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit services could enhance accessibility. Many residents rely on public transit, so policies that improve transit times and affordability are crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that minimize costs for residents while improving transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit accessibility, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and limited income."
