    "disposable_income": "Hermosa is a working-class neighborhood with moderate disposable income levels. Many residents are employed in blue-collar jobs, and the community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Hermosa have limited discretionary income, with a significant portion of their budget allocated to essential expenses such as housing, food, and transportation. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Hermosa has moderate access to public transportation, with several bus routes and a nearby Metra station. However, many residents rely on driving due to the convenience and time savings it offers compared to public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Hermosa's moderate income levels and reliance on both driving and public transit, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more residents to use public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax would help maintain disposable income for other essential expenses. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a reasonable sales tax, are prioritized."
