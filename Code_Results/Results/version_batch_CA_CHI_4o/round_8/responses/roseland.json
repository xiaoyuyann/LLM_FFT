    "disposable_income": "Roseland has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and sales taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Roseland has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the economic constraints of Roseland residents, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it leads to significant reductions in transit times, as this could improve access to jobs and services. The selected proposals balance these considerations by offering lower fares and taxes while slightly increasing driver fees to enhance transit service quality and reduce travel times."
