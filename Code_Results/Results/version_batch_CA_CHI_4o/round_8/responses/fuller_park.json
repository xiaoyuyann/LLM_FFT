    "disposable_income": "Fuller Park is one of the lower-income areas in Chicago, with a median household income significantly below the city average. Residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Fuller Park has moderate access to public transit, but the quality and frequency of service could be improved. Many residents rely on public transit due to lower car ownership rates, making transit fare and service quality critical factors.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the economic constraints and reliance on public transit, the community would benefit from policies that minimize costs while improving transit service. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to ensure affordability. Driver fees are less impactful as car ownership is lower, but they can help improve transit services. The selected policies balance affordability with improved transit times, which is crucial for residents who depend on public transportation for commuting and accessing services."
