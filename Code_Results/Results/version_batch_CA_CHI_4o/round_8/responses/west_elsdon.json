    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "West Elsdon has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but driving is also common. Reducing travel time and improving transit services are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance the budget impact and improve transit services. A lower sales tax is also favored to maintain disposable income for other expenses. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel time and improve transit without significantly increasing costs."
