    "disposable_income": "Uptown is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, including both low-income and middle-income residents. The disposable income varies significantly across the community, with some residents having limited financial flexibility.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on essentials and some discretionary items. However, a significant portion of the population may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Uptown has good access to public transportation, with several CTA bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times by transit are longer compared to driving, which may influence residents' mode of transportation choice.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the diverse income levels in Uptown, policies that minimize fare and fee increases while improving transit times are preferred. A lower sales tax is also beneficial to maintain discretionary spending. The community values improved transit services to reduce travel times, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals with moderate driver fees and fares, coupled with lower sales taxes, are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements."
