    "disposable_income": "Englewood has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Due to lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, taxes, and fees.",
    "accessibility": "Englewood has moderate access to public transit, but travel times are longer compared to driving. Improving transit efficiency and affordability is crucial for residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and the reliance on public transit, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The tradeoff involves balancing the need for affordable transit with the need for improved service and reduced travel times."
