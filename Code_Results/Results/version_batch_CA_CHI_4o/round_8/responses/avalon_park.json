    "disposable_income": "Avalon Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking priority. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Avalon Park has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but driving is also common. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance the budget impact and improve transit service. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on overall consumption. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times for both transit and driving, while keeping costs manageable for residents."
