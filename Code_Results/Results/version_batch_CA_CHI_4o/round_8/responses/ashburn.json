    "disposable_income": "Ashburn is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Ashburn has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit options are available but not as efficient as in more central areas. Many residents rely on driving, but there is potential for increased transit use if services improve.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on balancing costs with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents. The goal is to reduce travel times and improve service quality while keeping costs manageable."
