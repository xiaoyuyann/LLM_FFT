    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are more sensitive to changes in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in Grand Boulevard, as car ownership is lower than the city average. Therefore, policies that improve transit accessibility and affordability are highly beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the economic constraints and reliance on public transit in Grand Boulevard, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate sales taxes are preferred to keep transit affordable. Driver fees are acceptable if they significantly reduce travel times and improve transit services, as this could encourage a shift from driving to transit, benefiting the community by reducing congestion and emissions. The selected policies balance these factors by offering lower fares, reasonable sales taxes, and driver fees that enhance transit service without overly burdening residents financially."
