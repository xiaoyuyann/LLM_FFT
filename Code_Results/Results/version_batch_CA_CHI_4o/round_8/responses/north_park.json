    "disposable_income": "North Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but they can absorb moderate increases if they lead to significant improvements in service.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities. Residents are likely to prioritize transportation costs that do not significantly impact their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "North Park has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and reliability would be beneficial. Car ownership is moderate, and reducing driving times and costs would also be advantageous.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and balanced spending, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to minimize the impact on disposable income. Proposals that improve transit times and reduce driving times are prioritized to enhance accessibility. A balance between fare, tax, and driving fee is crucial to ensure affordability while improving service quality. Therefore, proposals with a $0.75 fare and moderate driving fees are favored, as they offer improved transit times without significantly increasing costs. A 1% tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as it aligns with the community's ability to absorb moderate cost increases for improved services."
