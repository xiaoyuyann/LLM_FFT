    "disposable_income": "Kenwood is a diverse community with a mix of middle to upper-middle-income residents. The disposable income varies, but many residents have a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kenwood have a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on housing, education, and leisure activities being significant.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has good access to public transportation, with several bus routes and proximity to the Metra Electric Line. However, driving is also common, and congestion can be an issue during peak hours.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use while not overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel time is crucial for both modes to enhance accessibility and reduce congestion. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable travel times are prioritized."
