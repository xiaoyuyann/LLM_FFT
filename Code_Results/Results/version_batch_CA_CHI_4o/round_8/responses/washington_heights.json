Car ownership is lower compared to other areas, emphasizing the need for affordable and efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life.

The community would benefit from improved transit services funded by these policies, as long as the costs remain manageable for residents."
