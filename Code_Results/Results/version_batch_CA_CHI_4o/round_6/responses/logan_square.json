    "disposable_income": "Logan Square has a diverse population with a mix of middle-income and lower-income residents. The disposable income varies significantly across the community, with some residents having limited financial flexibility.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a vibrant local economy with many small businesses, restaurants, and cultural venues. Residents value spending on local goods and services, but higher costs in transportation could impact their discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Logan Square is well-served by public transit, including the Blue Line and several bus routes. However, some areas are more car-dependent, and reducing travel times is important for both transit and driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transit and the need to balance costs, the priority is to reduce transit fares and driving times while maintaining a reasonable tax rate. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to improve transit efficiency and affordability, which is crucial for residents with limited disposable income."
