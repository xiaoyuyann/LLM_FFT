    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has a relatively lower median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are more sensitive to changes in costs related to transportation, taxes, and fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs or taxes could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "West Pullman has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting to work and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower income levels, proposals with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. However, improving transit times is also crucial to enhance accessibility and reduce travel time. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, but significant improvements in transit times, are prioritized. Proposals with higher driver fees are considered as they could reduce congestion and improve transit times, benefiting those who rely on public transportation."
