    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents have a moderate to high level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents of Edison Park likely have a higher level of discretionary consumption, spending on goods and services beyond basic necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Edison Park has good access to public transportation, including Metra and CTA services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting due to the suburban nature of the area.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The community values reduced travel times for both driving and transit, as many residents commute to work. Therefore, proposals that balance lower fares and fees with improved travel times are prioritized. The top choices reflect a preference for moderate transit fares and driver fees, with a focus on reducing travel times, especially for transit, to encourage its use and reduce congestion."
