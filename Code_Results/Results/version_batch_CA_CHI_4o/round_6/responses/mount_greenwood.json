    "disposable_income": "Mount Greenwood is a middle-class community with a relatively stable disposable income. Residents have a moderate level of financial flexibility, allowing them to absorb some increases in transportation costs, but significant increases could impact their discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, education, and leisure activities. Residents are likely to be sensitive to changes in transportation costs that could affect their ability to maintain their current lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Mount Greenwood has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit options are available but not as extensive as in more central areas. Many residents rely on driving for daily commutes, so policies that improve transit times or reduce driving costs could be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on both driving and transit, proposals that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with reasonable travel times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The top-ranked proposals aim to improve transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for both transit users and drivers. Proposals with higher driver fees are deprioritized due to the community's reliance on cars."
