    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "South Lawndale has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on it due to lower car ownership rates. Improving transit times and maintaining low costs are crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "The primary goal is to minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to keep transportation affordable. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel time and congestion, benefiting transit users. The community would benefit from policies that balance cost with improved transit service, as many residents rely on public transportation for daily commutes."
