    "disposable_income": "Roseland has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Roseland has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit service could greatly benefit the community by reducing travel times and increasing access to employment opportunities and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower income levels, minimizing costs is crucial. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and taxes are preferred. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which could reduce congestion and improve transit service. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this could enhance access to jobs and services, ultimately benefiting the community economically."
