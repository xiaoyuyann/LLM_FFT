    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a diverse population with a mix of income levels. The median household income is slightly below the city average, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Rogers Park have varied spending habits, with a significant portion of income going towards housing, food, and transportation. Discretionary spending is moderate, with some residents having limited flexibility in their budgets.",
    "accessibility": "Rogers Park is well-served by public transit, including the CTA Red Line and several bus routes. Car ownership is moderate, and many residents rely on public transit for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Proposals with higher driver fees are acceptable if they significantly reduce car travel time and improve transit services, as this could encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
