    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on a mix of necessities and leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but driving is also common. Improvements in transit times and services could benefit the community, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision-making process involved balancing the need for affordable transportation with the desire for improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to keep costs manageable for residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' budgets. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times while maintaining affordability, considering both transit and driving options."
