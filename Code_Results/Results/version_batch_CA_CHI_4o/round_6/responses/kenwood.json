    "disposable_income": "Kenwood is a diverse community with a mix of middle to upper-middle-income residents. The disposable income varies, but many residents have a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kenwood have a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on housing, education, and leisure activities being significant.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has good access to public transportation, with several bus routes and proximity to the Metra Electric Line. However, driving is also common, and congestion can be an issue during peak hours.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel time and improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to maintain discretionary spending. However, some increase in tax and fees is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times and reduces congestion. The community values efficient transit options and reduced travel times, so proposals that offer these benefits without excessively increasing costs are prioritized."
