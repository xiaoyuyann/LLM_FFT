    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn has a median household income that is lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Chicago Lawn have limited discretionary spending due to lower income levels, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget for other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago Lawn has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the need to reach jobs and services not easily accessible by transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize costs for both transit and driving. However, improving transit times is also important to make public transportation a more viable option. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on overall consumption. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel time while keeping costs manageable for residents."
