    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side is a diverse area with a mix of income levels, but generally has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to downtown Chicago and the presence of newer residential developments.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Near South Side have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and retail being significant due to the area's vibrant cultural and commercial offerings.",
    "accessibility": "The Near South Side has good accessibility to resources and services, with multiple public transit options including buses and trains, as well as easy access to major roads for driving. However, transit times can be long, and congestion is a concern for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slightly higher sales tax if it results in better transit services. Reducing transit times is a priority to improve accessibility and encourage public transit use. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it helps reduce congestion and emissions. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower transit fares, moderate sales tax, and moderate driver fees are preferred. The goal is to enhance transit service quality and reduce travel times without significantly impacting discretionary spending."
