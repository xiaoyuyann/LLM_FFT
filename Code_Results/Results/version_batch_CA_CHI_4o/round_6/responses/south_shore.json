    "disposable_income": "South Shore has a moderate to low average disposable income, with many residents relying on public transportation for commuting. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary spending is limited, with a significant portion of income allocated to essential expenses. Any increase in transportation costs could impact the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Public transportation is a crucial mode of transport in South Shore, providing access to employment, education, and other services. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income and reliance on public transit, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. A balance between affordability and improved transit service is key. Proposals with a moderate sales tax and lower fares are preferred to ensure transit remains accessible while supporting service improvements."
