    "disposable_income": "Riverdale is one of the lower-income areas in Chicago, with a significant portion of the population living below the poverty line. Disposable income is limited, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the limited disposable income, discretionary consumption is low. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Riverdale has limited access to resources and services, with public transit being a crucial mode of transportation for many residents. Improving transit times and maintaining low costs are essential for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the economic constraints and reliance on public transit in Riverdale, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected policies balance these factors, prioritizing affordability and improved transit access."
