    "disposable_income": "Chatham has a moderate level of disposable income, with many residents working in middle-income jobs. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as a significant portion of income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption in Chatham is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact the ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Chatham has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but driving is also common. Reducing travel time and improving transit services are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary consumption, Chatham residents would benefit from lower transit fares and minimal increases in sales tax and driving fees. The community values improved transit services and reduced travel times, but these should not come at a high cost. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes and fees are prioritized. The top-ranked proposals offer a balance between cost and improved transit services, with a focus on minimizing the financial burden on residents while enhancing accessibility."
