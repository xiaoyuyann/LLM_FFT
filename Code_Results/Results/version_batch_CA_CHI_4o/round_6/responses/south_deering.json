    "disposable_income": "South Deering has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "South Deering has limited access to public transit options, making it crucial to improve transit services to reduce travel times and increase accessibility to jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, it is important to minimize fare and fee increases while improving transit times. A lower sales tax is preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. Proposals that offer reduced travel times for both transit and driving are prioritized to enhance accessibility. The selected proposals balance the need for affordable transit fares, reasonable driver fees, and improved transit services, while considering the financial constraints of the community."
