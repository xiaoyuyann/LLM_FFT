    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a moderate level of disposable income, with a diverse population including middle-income families and a significant number of low-income households. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact the overall budget for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community's discretionary consumption is varied, with spending on essentials like housing, food, and education being prioritized. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "West Ridge has decent access to public transit, but travel times are relatively long compared to driving. Improving transit efficiency and reducing travel times could benefit the community, especially for those who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and the need to balance costs, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is important to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals that offer a balance between cost and improved service are prioritized."
