    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are likely to prioritize essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in East Garfield Park due to lower car ownership rates. Accessibility to jobs, education, and services is heavily reliant on efficient and affordable public transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, it is important to minimize costs associated with transportation, both in terms of fares and taxes. However, improving transit efficiency is also crucial to ensure accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes that also improve transit times are prioritized. High driver fees are less concerning due to lower car ownership. The selected proposals balance affordability with improved transit service, considering the community's reliance on public transportation."
