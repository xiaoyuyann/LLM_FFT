    "disposable_income": "Pullman is a community with a moderate level of disposable income. Many residents are working-class, and affordability is a key concern when it comes to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels. Residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Pullman has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but driving is also common. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability are important for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on both transit and driving, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't significantly impact disposable income. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs while supporting transit improvements."
