    "disposable_income": "Austin is a community with a median household income lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Austin have limited discretionary spending due to lower income levels, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Austin has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could greatly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and the reliance on public transit, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel times and improves transit services. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering reduced transit times and maintaining or slightly increasing costs, ensuring that the community can benefit from improved services without a substantial financial impact."
