    "disposable_income": "Washington Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Washington Park has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could greatly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower income levels, minimizing costs is crucial. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and taxes are preferred. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is also preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to provide a balance between affordability and improved transit service."
