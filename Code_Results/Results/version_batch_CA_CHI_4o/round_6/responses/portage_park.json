    "disposable_income": "Portage Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and non-essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, food, and transportation being significant. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Portage Park has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the convenience and time savings. Reducing travel time and improving transit services could encourage more residents to use public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The selected proposals aim to balance cost savings with improved accessibility and reduced travel times."
