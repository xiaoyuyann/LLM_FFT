    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and non-essential goods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on housing, food, and transportation being significant. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on other discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "Garfield Ridge has moderate accessibility to public transit, with some reliance on driving due to the community's layout and available services. Reducing travel time and improving transit services could benefit residents, but cost increases need to be carefully considered.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on balancing cost with improved service. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use while keeping costs manageable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The goal is to reduce travel time and improve service without overly burdening residents financially."
