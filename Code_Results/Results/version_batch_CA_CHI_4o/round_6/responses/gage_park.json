    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income below the city average. Residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "Gage Park has moderate access to public transit, with several bus routes and a nearby train line. However, transit times are relatively long, and many residents rely on driving for quicker commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance affordability with improved transit times. Lower fares and taxes are favored to reduce financial strain, while moderate driver fees are acceptable if they significantly improve transit times. The goal is to enhance accessibility without imposing excessive costs on residents."
