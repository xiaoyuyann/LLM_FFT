    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch is a working-class neighborhood with moderate disposable income levels. Residents are sensitive to increases in transportation costs, as these can significantly impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce spending on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Hegewisch has limited public transit options, with residents relying heavily on driving. Improving transit times and reducing costs could encourage more residents to use public transportation, but driving remains a primary mode of transport.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on driving, the community would benefit from policies that balance lower transit fares and driving fees with reasonable sales tax rates. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is also crucial. The selected policies aim to minimize costs while improving transit services, considering the community's reliance on driving and the need for affordable transportation options."
