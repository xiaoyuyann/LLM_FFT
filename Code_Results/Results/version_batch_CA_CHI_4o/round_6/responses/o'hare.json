    "disposable_income": "O'Hare is a middle-income community with a mix of residential and commercial areas. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some flexibility in spending but with a need to manage costs effectively.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in O'Hare have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services. The community values cost-effective transportation options to maintain their standard of living.",
    "accessibility": "O'Hare has good access to public transportation, including the Blue Line and bus services, but also relies heavily on car travel due to its proximity to the airport and major highways. Reducing travel time and cost is important for both modes of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes reducing travel time and costs for both transit and driving, while considering the impact of taxes on disposable income. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial to maintain affordability and accessibility. The selected proposals aim to enhance transit services without significantly increasing the financial burden on residents."
