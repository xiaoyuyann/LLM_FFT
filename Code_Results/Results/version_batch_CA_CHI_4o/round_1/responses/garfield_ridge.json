    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and non-essential goods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, food, and transportation being significant. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on other discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "Garfield Ridge has moderate access to public transit, with some reliance on driving due to the community's layout and connectivity. Reducing travel time and improving transit services are important for enhancing accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance the budget impact and improve transit services. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel time and costs, making transit a more attractive option while considering the community's financial constraints."
