    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are likely to prioritize essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in East Garfield Park due to lower car ownership rates. Accessibility to jobs, education, and healthcare via transit is vital.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. However, improving transit service is also important to enhance accessibility. A balance between affordable costs and improved transit times is crucial. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden the residents' limited discretionary spending."
