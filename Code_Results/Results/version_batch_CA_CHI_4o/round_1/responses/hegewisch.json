    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch is a working-class neighborhood with moderate disposable income levels. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can significantly impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce spending on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Hegewisch has limited public transit options, with residents relying heavily on driving. Improving transit accessibility and reducing travel times could benefit the community, but cost increases must be carefully balanced.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on driving, the community would benefit from policies that reduce travel times without significantly increasing costs. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees could encourage a shift to public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. However, the community is sensitive to sales tax increases, which could impact overall consumption. Therefore, policies with lower sales taxes and moderate fare and fee structures are prioritized."
