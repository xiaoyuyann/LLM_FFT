    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Due to lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, taxes, and fees.",
    "accessibility": "North Lawndale has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit services could significantly benefit the community by reducing travel times and increasing access to employment and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, it is crucial to minimize costs while improving transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid burdening residents with additional costs. The selected proposals aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and the need for better accessibility."
