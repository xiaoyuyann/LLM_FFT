    "disposable_income": "Kenwood is a diverse community with a mix of middle to upper-middle-income households. The disposable income varies, but many residents have moderate to high disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kenwood have a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and cultural activities being common. However, there is a need to balance transportation costs with other living expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has good access to public transportation, with several bus routes and proximity to the Metra Electric Line. However, driving is also common, and reducing travel time is a priority for many residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate to high disposable income, a slight increase in sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel time is crucial, especially for those who commute to work. A lower transit fare is preferred to encourage public transportation use, but a moderate fare is acceptable if it results in better service. A moderate driver fee is acceptable to reduce congestion and emissions, as long as it leads to improved transit options. The selected proposals balance these factors, aiming to improve transit times and services while considering the financial impact on residents."
