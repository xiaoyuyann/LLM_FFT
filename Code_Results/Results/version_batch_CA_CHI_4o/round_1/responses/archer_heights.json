    "disposable_income": "Archer Heights is a middle-income community with a significant portion of residents working in blue-collar jobs. The community has a moderate level of disposable income, which means that any increase in transportation costs could impact their budget for other essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Archer Heights have limited discretionary spending. They prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Archer Heights has moderate access to public transit, with some residents relying on it for commuting. However, many residents also use personal vehicles due to the convenience and time savings. Improving transit times could encourage more residents to switch from driving to public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to keep transportation costs low while improving transit efficiency. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fees can encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The selected proposals balance cost savings with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both transit and personal vehicles."
