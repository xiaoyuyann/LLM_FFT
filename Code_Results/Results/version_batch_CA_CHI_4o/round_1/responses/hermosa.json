    "disposable_income": "Hermosa is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income below the city average. Residents are sensitive to increases in transportation costs, as they have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Hermosa has moderate access to public transit, with some reliance on buses and nearby train lines. Many residents use public transit for commuting, but some also rely on cars due to the area's layout and connectivity.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes minimizing costs for residents while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to balance affordability with improved transit service, considering Hermosa's economic constraints and transportation needs."
