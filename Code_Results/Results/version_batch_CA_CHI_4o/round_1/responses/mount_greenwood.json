    "disposable_income": "Mount Greenwood is a middle-class community with a relatively stable disposable income. Residents have a moderate level of financial flexibility, allowing them to absorb some increases in transportation costs, but significant increases could impact their discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services. Residents are likely to be sensitive to changes in transportation costs that could reduce their ability to spend on these activities.",
    "accessibility": "Mount Greenwood has decent accessibility to resources and services, but it is primarily a car-dependent area. Public transit options are available but not as convenient or fast as driving. Improvements in transit times could encourage more residents to use public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on cars and moderate disposable income, the focus is on balancing cost with improved transit times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing transit times and maintaining reasonable costs for both transit and driving."
