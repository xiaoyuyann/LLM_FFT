    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Park is a relatively affluent community with a higher average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can generally afford higher transportation costs, but they still value cost-effective solutions.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lincoln Park have a high level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and other leisure activities. They prefer policies that do not significantly impact their ability to spend on these activities.",
    "accessibility": "Lincoln Park has good access to public transportation, with multiple bus and train lines. However, traffic congestion can be an issue, making efficient transit options appealing to reduce travel time.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can handle a moderate increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The community values efficient transit options to reduce congestion and improve travel times. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, combined with lower sales taxes, are prioritized. The top choices reflect a balance between cost and improved transit efficiency, with a slight preference for lower sales taxes to maintain discretionary spending."
