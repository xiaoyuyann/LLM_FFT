    "disposable_income": "McKinley Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "McKinley Park has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and reliability could significantly benefit the community. Many residents rely on both public transit and driving, so policies that improve transit without significantly increasing costs are preferred.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to maintain disposable income for other expenses. The selected policies aim to balance these factors, prioritizing reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving."
