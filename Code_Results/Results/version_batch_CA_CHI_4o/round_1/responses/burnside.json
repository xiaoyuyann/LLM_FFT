    "disposable_income": "Burnside is a community with a relatively low median household income compared to the city average. Residents are sensitive to changes in costs, whether through taxes, fares, or fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Burnside has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "The primary goal is to minimize the financial burden on residents while improving transit accessibility. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to keep costs down, but some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it leads to better transit services and reduced congestion. The selected proposals aim to balance these factors by choosing options with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents."
