    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in Grand Boulevard, as car ownership is lower than the city average. Therefore, policies that improve transit accessibility and reduce travel time are highly beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the economic constraints and reliance on public transit, the community would benefit from policies that minimize fare increases while improving transit times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Driver fees are less impactful as car ownership is lower, but they can help improve transit services. The selected policies balance these factors by offering reduced transit fares and improved travel times without significantly increasing the sales tax burden."
