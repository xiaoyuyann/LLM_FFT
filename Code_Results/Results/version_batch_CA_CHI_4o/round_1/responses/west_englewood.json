    "disposable_income": "West Englewood is a lower-income community with limited disposable income. Many residents rely on public transportation due to the high cost of car ownership.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, making any increase in transportation costs a significant burden.",
    "accessibility": "Public transportation is crucial for accessing jobs, education, and healthcare. However, current transit times are long, and improvements in transit efficiency would greatly benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "The primary goal is to minimize costs for residents while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel times and improves transit services. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The chosen policies aim to improve transit times without imposing high costs on residents."
