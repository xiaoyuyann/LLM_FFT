    "disposable_income": "Hyde Park is a diverse community with a mix of students, professionals, and long-term residents. The presence of the University of Chicago contributes to a range of income levels, with some residents having higher disposable incomes while others, such as students, may have limited financial resources.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a variety of local businesses, restaurants, and cultural institutions, indicating a moderate level of discretionary consumption. Residents may prioritize spending on education, dining, and cultural activities.",
    "accessibility": "Hyde Park has good access to public transportation, including buses and the Metra train, which connects to downtown Chicago. However, transit times can be lengthy, and driving is a common alternative for those with access to a vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the diverse income levels and the importance of both transit and driving in Hyde Park, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, coupled with reasonable travel times, are prioritized. The community values efficient transit options to reduce travel time and improve accessibility to the rest of the city."
