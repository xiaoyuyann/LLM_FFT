    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents in Forest Glen likely have a higher level of discretionary consumption. However, they may still be sensitive to changes in costs that could impact their lifestyle, such as increased taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "Forest Glen has good access to public transportation, including Metra and CTA services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting. The community values efficient and reliable transit options to maintain accessibility to the city and surrounding areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's higher income and reliance on both transit and personal vehicles, the focus is on balancing cost with improved transit service and reduced travel times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use while maintaining affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reduced travel times and reasonable costs, reflecting the community's desire for efficient and cost-effective transportation options."
