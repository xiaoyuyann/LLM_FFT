    "disposable_income": "Edgewater is a diverse community with a mix of income levels. The median household income is moderate, with a significant portion of residents being middle-income earners. There is also a notable presence of students and retirees, which affects the overall disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Edgewater have varied discretionary spending patterns, with a focus on housing, dining, and cultural activities. The community values affordability and accessibility in transportation to maintain their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Edgewater has good access to public transportation, including several CTA train lines and bus routes. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting, and there is a moderate level of car ownership. Accessibility to resources and services is generally high, but improvements in transit efficiency and cost could benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Edgewater's reliance on public transit and the moderate disposable income, the community would benefit from policies that lower transit fares and improve service efficiency. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it significantly reduces car travel time and congestion, encouraging a shift to public transit. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced transit fares, moderate driver fees, and manageable sales tax rates, leading to improved transit times and overall accessibility."
