    "disposable_income": "Auburn Gresham has a median household income lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current transit times are long, and improvements could greatly benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, it is important to keep transit fares low to ensure affordability. However, improving transit times is also crucial to enhance accessibility and reduce travel burdens. A balance between low fares and improved transit service is needed. Proposals with a moderate sales tax and driver fees that encourage a shift from driving to transit, thereby reducing congestion and emissions, are preferred. The selected proposals aim to improve transit times while keeping costs manageable for residents."
