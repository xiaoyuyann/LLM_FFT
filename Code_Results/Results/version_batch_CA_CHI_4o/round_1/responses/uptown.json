    "disposable_income": "Uptown is a diverse community with a mix of income levels. There are both high-income residents and lower-income residents, with a significant portion of the population being middle-income. This means that any increase in costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes, could have varying impacts across the community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Uptown residents have a moderate level of discretionary consumption. Many residents spend on dining, entertainment, and cultural activities, which are abundant in the area. However, a significant portion of the population may prioritize essential spending, making them sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Uptown has good access to public transportation, with several CTA train lines and bus routes serving the area. This makes transit a viable option for many residents. However, driving is also common, especially for those commuting to areas not well-served by transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the diverse income levels and the importance of both transit and driving in Uptown, the ideal policy would balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with reasonable travel times, are prioritized. The goal is to minimize the financial burden while improving transit efficiency and accessibility."
