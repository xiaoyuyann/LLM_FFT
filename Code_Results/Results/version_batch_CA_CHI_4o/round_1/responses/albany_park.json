    "disposable_income": "Albany Park is a diverse community with a mix of income levels. The median household income is slightly below the city average, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Albany Park have moderate discretionary spending. They prioritize essential goods and services, with limited room for additional expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Albany Park has good access to public transit, with several bus lines and the Brown Line serving the area. Car ownership is moderate, and many residents rely on public transit for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on public transit, Albany Park would benefit from policies that keep transit fares low while improving service. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. A moderate driver fee could encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering lower fares and moderate driver fees, with a focus on improving transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents."
