    "disposable_income": "Irving Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some discretionary spending but with sensitivity to increases in living costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Irving Park have moderate discretionary consumption. They spend on essentials and have some flexibility for non-essential goods and services, but significant increases in costs could impact their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Irving Park has decent access to public transit, with several bus lines and the Blue Line providing connectivity. However, driving is also common due to the community's layout and the need for flexibility in travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, policies with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize financial strain. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, and reasonable driving fees that improve transit times, are prioritized. The community would benefit from reduced travel times without significant increases in costs, encouraging a shift from driving to transit and reducing congestion."
