    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income below the city average. Residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Gage Park has moderate access to public transit, with several bus routes and a nearby train line. However, transit times are relatively long, and many residents rely on driving for quicker commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes minimizing costs for residents while improving transit times. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden. Proposals with moderate driver fees are considered to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, improving overall travel times. The focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit service to benefit the community's economic constraints and transportation needs."
