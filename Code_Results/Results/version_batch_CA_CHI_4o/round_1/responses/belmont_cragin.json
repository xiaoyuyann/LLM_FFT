The community has a moderate level of disposable income, which means that any increase in transportation costs could impact their budget for other essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Belmont Cragin have limited discretionary spending due to their income levels. They prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Belmont Cragin has moderate access to public transit, with some residents relying on buses and trains for commuting. Car ownership is also common, but traffic congestion can be an issue. Improving transit times and reducing congestion would benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to choose policies that minimize additional costs while improving transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The selected policies aim to balance cost with improved accessibility and reduced travel times."
