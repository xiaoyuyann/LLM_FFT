    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income households. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but there is some flexibility to absorb minor increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs could impact discretionary spending, but the community can manage moderate changes.",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban layout. Improving transit times could encourage more residents to switch from driving to public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A balanced approach with a moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reduced transit times and reasonable costs, considering the community's income and consumption patterns."
