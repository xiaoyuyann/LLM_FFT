    "disposable_income": "Woodlawn has a moderate to low average disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary spending is limited, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact residents' ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Woodlawn has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could greatly benefit the community, especially for those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income in Woodlawn, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Reducing travel time is also a priority to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. The selected proposals balance affordability with improved transit service and reduced travel times."
