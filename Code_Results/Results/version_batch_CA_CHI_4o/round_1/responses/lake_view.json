    "disposable_income": "Lake View is a relatively affluent community with a higher-than-average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can generally afford moderate increases in transportation costs without significant impact on their overall financial well-being.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake View have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and other leisure activities. They value convenience and time savings, which can influence their transportation choices.",
    "accessibility": "Lake View has good accessibility to public transit, with several CTA train lines and bus routes serving the area. However, traffic congestion can be an issue, making efficient transit options appealing to reduce travel time.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's higher disposable income and discretionary spending, a moderate increase in transit fare and driver fees is acceptable if it results in significant time savings. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The community values reduced travel times and improved transit services, which can be achieved by encouraging a shift from driving to transit through higher driver fees. Therefore, proposals that balance these factors with moderate costs are prioritized."
