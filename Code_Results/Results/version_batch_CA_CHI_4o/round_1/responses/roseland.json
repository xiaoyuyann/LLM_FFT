    "disposable_income": "Roseland has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Roseland has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the economic constraints of Roseland residents, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve disposable income. However, improving transit times is crucial, so some trade-offs are made to achieve better service. The selected proposals balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and limited financial flexibility."
