    "decision_rationale": "Given the reliance on public transit and the moderate income levels, the community would benefit from lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes to maintain affordability. Reducing travel time is also important to improve quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit services and reduce congestion, are prioritized. A balance between tax rates and fare/fee structures is crucial to ensure that residents are not overly burdened financially while still benefiting from improved transit services."
