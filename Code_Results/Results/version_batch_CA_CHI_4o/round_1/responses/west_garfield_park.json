    "disposable_income": "West Garfield Park is a lower-income community with limited disposable income. Many residents rely on public transportation due to the high cost of car ownership.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, making any increase in transportation costs a significant burden.",
    "accessibility": "Public transportation is crucial for accessing jobs, education, and services. The community has a high reliance on transit, and improvements in transit service could significantly benefit residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "The primary goal is to minimize costs for residents while improving transit accessibility. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering reduced transit fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit service and reduce travel times without significantly increasing costs for residents."
