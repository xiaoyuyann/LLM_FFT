    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are likely to prioritize essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "South Lawndale has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit services could significantly benefit the community by providing better access to jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, it is crucial to keep costs low for both transit and driving. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. A lower fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The community would benefit from a balance between cost and improved transit service, so proposals with a 0.5% or 1% sales tax and lower fares are preferred."
