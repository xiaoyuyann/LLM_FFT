    "disposable_income": "Greater Grand Crossing has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The community relies heavily on public transit due to lower car ownership rates. Efficient and affordable transit options are crucial for accessing jobs, education, and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transit and sensitivity to cost increases, the priority is to minimize fare and tax increases while improving transit efficiency. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A balance between maintaining affordable transit and improving service quality is essential. Therefore, proposals with a $0.75 fare and moderate driver fees are prioritized, as they offer reduced travel times without significantly increasing costs. A 1% sales tax is acceptable if it results in better transit services, as long as fare and fee increases are minimized."
