    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents in Forest Glen likely have higher discretionary spending on goods and services. However, they may still be sensitive to significant increases in costs that could impact their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Forest Glen has good access to public transportation, including Metra and CTA services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting. The community values efficient and reliable transit options to maintain accessibility to the city and surrounding areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's higher income, a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fare is acceptable if it results in improved transit services and reduced travel times. However, the community is likely to prefer policies that balance cost with tangible benefits in travel efficiency. A higher driver fee is acceptable if it significantly reduces congestion and travel time, benefiting both drivers and transit users. The community would prioritize policies that offer the best improvement in transit times and overall travel efficiency while maintaining reasonable costs."
