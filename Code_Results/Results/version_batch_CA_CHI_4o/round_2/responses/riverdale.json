    "disposable_income": "Riverdale is one of the lower-income areas in Chicago, with a significant portion of the population living below the poverty line. Disposable income is limited, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Due to limited disposable income, discretionary consumption is low. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Riverdale has limited access to resources and services, with public transit being a crucial mode of transportation for many residents. Improving transit times and maintaining low costs are essential for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies with lower fares and taxes are prioritized. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, the chosen policies aim to minimize costs while improving or maintaining transit efficiency. A lower sales tax is preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents, and moderate driver fees are acceptable if they significantly improve transit times, potentially encouraging a shift from driving to transit."
