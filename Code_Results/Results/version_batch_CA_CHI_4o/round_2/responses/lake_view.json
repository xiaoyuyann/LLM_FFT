    "disposable_income": "Lake View is a relatively affluent community with a higher than average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents can generally afford moderate increases in transportation costs without significant impact on their overall financial well-being.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake View have a high level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and other leisure activities. They value convenience and time savings, which influences their transportation choices.",
    "accessibility": "Lake View has good access to public transportation, with several CTA train lines and bus routes serving the area. However, traffic congestion can be an issue, making efficient transit options appealing to residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, Lake View residents are likely to prioritize policies that improve transit efficiency and reduce travel time, even if it means slightly higher costs. They are willing to pay for better services and reduced congestion. Therefore, proposals with moderate to high driver fees and fares, which lead to significant reductions in travel time, are preferred. A moderate sales tax is acceptable as it supports transit improvements without overly burdening residents financially."
