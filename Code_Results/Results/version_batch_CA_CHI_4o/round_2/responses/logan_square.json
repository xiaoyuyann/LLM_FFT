    "disposable_income": "Logan Square has a diverse population with a mix of middle-income and lower-income residents. The disposable income varies significantly across the community, with some residents having limited financial flexibility.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a vibrant local economy with many small businesses, restaurants, and cultural venues. Residents value spending on local goods and services, but higher costs in transportation could impact their discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Logan Square is well-served by public transit, including the Blue Line and several bus routes. However, some areas are more car-dependent, and reducing travel times for both modes is important for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's mixed income levels, lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial strain. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is crucial to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals that balance lower costs with improved travel times are prioritized. The top choices reflect a preference for lower fares and moderate driver fees, with a willingness to accept a moderate sales tax for better transit services."
