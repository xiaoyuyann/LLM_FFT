    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income lower than the city average. Residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents prioritize essential spending over discretionary consumption. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "Gage Park has moderate access to public transit, with several bus routes and a nearby train line. However, transit times are relatively long, and many residents rely on driving for quicker commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance affordability with improved transit times. Lower fares and taxes are crucial to minimize financial strain, while moderate driver fees are acceptable if they significantly reduce travel times. The community benefits from improved transit services, but not at the expense of high costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and taxes, combined with moderate driver fees that enhance transit efficiency, are ranked higher."
