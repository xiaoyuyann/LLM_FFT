    "disposable_income": "Calumet Heights is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Calumet Heights has moderate access to public transit, with some reliance on driving due to the layout and connectivity of the area. Reducing travel time and improving transit services would be beneficial, but cost increases need to be carefully managed.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A balanced approach with a moderate sales tax is chosen to support transit improvements without overly burdening residents. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel time and improve service quality while keeping costs manageable."
