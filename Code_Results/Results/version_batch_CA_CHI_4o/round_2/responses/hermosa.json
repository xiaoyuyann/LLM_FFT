    "disposable_income": "Hermosa is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income below the city average. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through taxes, fares, or fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Hermosa has moderate access to public transit, with some reliance on driving. Improving transit times could benefit residents, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision focuses on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and taxes are prioritized to minimize financial strain, while moderate driver fees are acceptable if they lead to reduced congestion and better transit times. The goal is to enhance transit accessibility without imposing excessive financial burdens on residents."
