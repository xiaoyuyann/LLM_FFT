    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as a significant portion of income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Bridgeport have limited discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Bridgeport has decent access to public transportation, with several bus lines and proximity to the CTA Red Line. However, travel times can be long, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to minimize additional costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on overall consumption. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while maintaining a reasonable tax rate to support transit improvements."
