    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income below the city average. Residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago Lawn has moderate access to public transit, with several bus routes but limited train access. Improving transit efficiency and affordability is crucial for residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it results in better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents. The top-ranked policies offer a combination of reduced travel times and costs, making transit more attractive while considering the community's financial constraints."
