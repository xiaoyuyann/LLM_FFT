    "disposable_income": "Portage Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The disposable income is moderate, meaning residents are sensitive to increases in costs that could affect their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Portage Park have moderate discretionary spending. They prioritize essential goods and services, but also value affordable leisure and recreational activities. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Portage Park has decent access to public transportation, with several bus routes and proximity to the Blue Line. However, many residents rely on cars for commuting due to the convenience and time savings. Improving transit times could encourage more residents to use public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary spending, it is important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use while not overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is a priority to enhance accessibility and convenience. The selected proposals aim to provide a balance between affordability and improved transit services, encouraging a shift from driving to public transit where feasible."
