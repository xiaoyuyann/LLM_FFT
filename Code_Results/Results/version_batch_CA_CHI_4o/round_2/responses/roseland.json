    "disposable_income": "Roseland has a relatively low median household income compared to the city average, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Roseland has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the economic constraints of Roseland residents, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and driver fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. However, some increase in sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents. The selected proposals aim to balance these factors by choosing options that reduce travel time and maintain or lower costs, especially for transit users, who are likely a significant portion of the community."
