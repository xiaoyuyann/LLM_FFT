    "disposable_income": "The Near West Side has a diverse population with varying income levels, but generally, it has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to downtown and the presence of young professionals and students.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Near West Side tend to have higher discretionary spending on dining, entertainment, and other urban lifestyle activities, given the area's vibrant cultural and social scene.",
    "accessibility": "The Near West Side benefits from excellent public transportation options, including multiple CTA train lines and bus routes, making it highly accessible by transit. Car ownership is moderate, with some residents relying on driving for convenience.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slightly higher transit fare if it results in significantly improved service. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it enhances transit infrastructure, as many residents rely on public transportation. A moderate driver fee is also acceptable to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. The focus is on balancing cost with improved transit times and service quality. Therefore, proposals with a moderate fare and driver fee, coupled with a moderate sales tax, are prioritized to ensure better transit service without overly burdening residents financially."
