    "disposable_income": "Ashburn is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on housing, food, and other essentials taking priority. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Ashburn has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is used by a significant portion of the community, but many residents also rely on driving. Improvements in transit times and costs could benefit the community by providing more efficient and affordable transportation options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on balancing costs with improvements in service. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability while encouraging transit use. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The goal is to reduce travel times and costs without significantly impacting disposable income."
