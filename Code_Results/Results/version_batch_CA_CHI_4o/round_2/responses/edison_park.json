    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services. Residents may be sensitive to changes in transportation costs that could impact their discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Edison Park has good access to public transportation, including Metra rail services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting. The community values efficient and cost-effective transportation options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, Edison Park residents can absorb some increase in transportation costs, but they value efficiency and time savings. Proposals that reduce travel time, even with slightly higher costs, are preferred. A balance between reasonable transit fares and driving fees, along with moderate sales tax, is ideal to ensure quality transit services without significantly impacting discretionary spending. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driving fees are prioritized to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion."
