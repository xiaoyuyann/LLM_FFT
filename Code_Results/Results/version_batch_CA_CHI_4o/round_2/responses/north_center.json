    "disposable_income": "North Center is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher disposable income, residents of North Center tend to have higher discretionary spending on goods and services. However, they are also sensitive to changes in costs that could impact their lifestyle and consumption patterns.",
    "accessibility": "North Center has good access to public transit options, including buses and the Brown Line 'L' train, making it convenient for residents to use public transportation. Car ownership is also common, and driving is a viable option for many residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, North Center residents can absorb moderate increases in transit fares and driver fees. However, they would prefer policies that improve transit efficiency and reduce travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, policies that balance lower fares and fees with improved transit times are prioritized. The community values reduced congestion and emissions, so policies that encourage transit use over driving are favorable. The top-ranked policies reflect a balance between cost, improved transit times, and maintaining discretionary income."
