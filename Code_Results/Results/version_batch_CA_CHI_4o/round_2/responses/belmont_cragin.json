    "disposable_income": "Belmont Cragin is a middle-income community with a significant portion of residents working in blue-collar jobs. The community has a moderate level of disposable income, which means that any increase in transportation costs could impact their budget for other essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Belmont Cragin have limited discretionary spending due to their income levels. They prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Belmont Cragin has moderate access to public transit, with some residents relying on buses and trains to commute to work. Car ownership is also common, but traffic congestion can be an issue. Improving transit times and reducing congestion would benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to choose policies that minimize additional costs while improving transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid impacting residents' budgets significantly. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a reasonable sales tax, are prioritized. The selected proposals aim to balance cost savings with improved transit accessibility and reduced travel times."
