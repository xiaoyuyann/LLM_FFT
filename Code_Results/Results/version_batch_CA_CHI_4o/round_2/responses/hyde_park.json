    "disposable_income": "Hyde Park is a diverse community with a mix of students, professionals, and long-term residents. The presence of the University of Chicago contributes to a range of income levels, with some residents having higher disposable incomes, while students and lower-income residents may have less.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a variety of dining, shopping, and cultural options, indicating a moderate level of discretionary consumption. Residents may prioritize spending on education, dining, and cultural activities.",
    "accessibility": "Hyde Park has good access to public transportation, including buses and the Metra train, which connects to downtown Chicago. Car ownership is moderate, and many residents rely on public transit for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transit and the presence of students and lower-income residents, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are preferred to minimize financial burden. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility and convenience. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that reduce travel time are prioritized. A balance between supporting transit services through taxes and maintaining affordability for residents is crucial."
