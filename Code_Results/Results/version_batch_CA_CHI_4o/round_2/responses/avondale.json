    "disposable_income": "Avondale is a diverse community with a mix of income levels. The median household income is moderate, suggesting that residents are sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Avondale have a moderate level of discretionary spending. They are likely to be affected by changes in transit fares and sales taxes, as these could reduce their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Avondale has good access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times by transit are longer compared to driving, which may influence residents' preferences for policies that improve transit efficiency.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on public transit, Avondale would benefit from policies that reduce transit fares and improve service efficiency. Lower fares would make transit more affordable, while moderate driver fees could encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion. A lower sales tax would preserve disposable income for other expenditures. Therefore, the preferred policies are those that balance lower fares and moderate driver fees with minimal increases in sales tax."
