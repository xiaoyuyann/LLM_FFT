    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Due to lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, taxes, and fees.",
    "accessibility": "North Lawndale has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit services could significantly benefit the community by reducing travel times and increasing access to employment and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, it is crucial to minimize costs while improving transit services. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. However, some increase in driver fees is acceptable if it leads to significant improvements in transit times, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected proposals balance these considerations by offering reduced transit times and moderate costs, ensuring that the community can benefit from improved services without excessive financial strain."
