    "disposable_income": "Uptown has a diverse population with varying income levels, including both low-income and middle-income residents. The disposable income varies significantly across the community, with some residents having limited financial flexibility.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the mixed-income nature of Uptown, discretionary consumption is varied. Many residents prioritize essential expenses, but there is also a segment that can afford more discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Uptown is well-served by public transit, including several CTA train lines and bus routes. Car ownership is moderate, and many residents rely on public transit for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering Uptown's reliance on public transit and the mixed-income demographic, the focus is on maintaining affordable transit fares while improving service efficiency. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Moderate driver fees are acceptable if they significantly reduce car travel time and improve transit service. The selected proposals balance these factors, prioritizing affordable transit fares and reasonable travel times for both transit and driving."
