    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The disposable income is moderate, allowing for some discretionary spending but with sensitivity to increases in living costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jefferson Park have moderate discretionary consumption, with spending on housing, transportation, and leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Jefferson Park has good access to public transportation, including the CTA Blue Line and several bus routes. However, many residents also rely on cars for commuting, given the community's suburban characteristics.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both public transit and cars, the community would benefit from policies that balance lower costs with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The community would prefer policies that reduce travel time for both transit and driving, as this would enhance accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales taxes are prioritized."
