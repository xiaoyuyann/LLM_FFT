    "disposable_income": "Oakland is a community with a moderate to low average disposable income. Many residents may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, discretionary consumption is likely limited. Residents prioritize essential expenses, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget for other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Oakland has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit service could enhance accessibility. Many residents rely on public transit, so policies that improve transit times and service quality are beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance affordability with improved transit service. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit service. The top-ranked policies offer a combination of reduced travel times and reasonable costs, considering the community's income constraints and reliance on public transit."
