    "disposable_income": "Humboldt Park has a median household income lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, discretionary spending is constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Humboldt Park has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could enhance accessibility. Many residents rely on public transit, so fare reductions and improved service are beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income, proposals with lower fares and taxes are prioritized to minimize financial burden. However, improved transit times are also crucial, so some trade-offs with slightly higher costs are considered if they significantly enhance service. The goal is to balance affordability with improved accessibility and service quality."
