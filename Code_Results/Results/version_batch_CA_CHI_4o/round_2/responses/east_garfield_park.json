    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited, and residents are likely to prioritize essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in East Garfield Park due to lower car ownership rates. Accessibility to jobs, education, and services is heavily reliant on efficient and affordable public transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, it is important to prioritize policies that minimize costs for residents while improving transit efficiency. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting the community. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid further burdening residents' limited budgets. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also improve transit times, are prioritized. The tradeoff between fare, tax, and driver fee is balanced to ensure affordability and improved transit service."
