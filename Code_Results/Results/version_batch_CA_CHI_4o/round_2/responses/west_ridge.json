    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a moderate level of disposable income, with a diverse population including middle-income families and a significant number of low-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence, but also some spending on non-essentials.",
    "accessibility": "West Ridge has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the spread-out nature of the area and the need to access jobs and services outside the immediate vicinity.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower fare and driving fee are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. However, improving transit times is also crucial to encourage public transport use and reduce congestion. A balance between a reasonable sales tax and improved transit service is necessary. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also offer reduced travel times, are prioritized. The selected proposals aim to enhance transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for residents."
