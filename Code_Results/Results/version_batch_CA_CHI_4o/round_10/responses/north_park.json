    "disposable_income": "North Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but they can absorb moderate increases if they lead to significant improvements in service.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities. Residents are likely to prioritize transportation costs that do not significantly impact their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "North Park has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and reliability would be beneficial. Car ownership is moderate, and reducing driving times and congestion would be advantageous.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and balanced consumption, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Proposals that improve transit times and reduce driving times are prioritized to enhance accessibility and reduce congestion. The community is willing to accept a moderate sales tax if it results in significant improvements in transit services. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower fares, moderate taxes, and reasonable driving fees are ranked higher."
