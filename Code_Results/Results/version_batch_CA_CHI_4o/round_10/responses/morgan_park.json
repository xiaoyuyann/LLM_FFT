    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income households. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but there is some flexibility to absorb minor increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs could impact discretionary spending, but the community can manage moderate changes.",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban nature of the area. Improving transit times could encourage more residents to switch from driving to public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use, while a moderate sales tax supports transit improvements. The focus is on balancing cost with improved service to enhance accessibility and reduce driving times."
