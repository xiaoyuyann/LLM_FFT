    "disposable_income": "West Lawn is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials like housing and food taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "West Lawn has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is used by a significant portion of the population, but many residents also rely on driving. Improvements in transit times and costs could benefit the community, but not at the expense of significantly higher taxes or fees.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision-making process involved balancing the need for affordable transportation with the desire for improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The top-ranked proposals reflect a preference for lower fares and moderate driver fees, with a focus on reducing travel times for both transit and driving. The community is willing to accept a slightly higher sales tax if it results in significant improvements in transit efficiency and accessibility."
