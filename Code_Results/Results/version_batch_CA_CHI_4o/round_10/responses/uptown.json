    "disposable_income": "Uptown has a diverse population with a mix of income levels, including both low-income and middle-income residents. The disposable income varies significantly across the community, with some residents having limited financial flexibility.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the diverse income levels, discretionary consumption varies. Many residents prioritize essential expenses, but there is also a segment that can afford more discretionary spending. The community values affordable transportation options to maintain their quality of life.",
    "accessibility": "Uptown is well-served by public transit, with access to multiple bus lines and the Red Line train. However, travel times can be long, and improving transit efficiency is a priority. Car ownership is moderate, and reducing congestion is important for those who drive.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes reducing transit fares and improving travel times to benefit low-income residents who rely on public transit. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Driver fees are considered to reduce congestion and encourage transit use. The selected proposals balance affordability, improved transit efficiency, and moderate tax increases to support transit improvements."
