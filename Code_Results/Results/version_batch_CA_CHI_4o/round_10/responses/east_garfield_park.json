    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents have limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, leaving less room for discretionary consumption. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "East Garfield Park has moderate access to public transit, but travel times are longer compared to driving. Improving transit efficiency and affordability is crucial for residents who rely on it.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, minimizing costs is a priority. Lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to maintain affordability of other goods and services. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate improvements in transit times are prioritized. The tradeoff involves balancing cost savings with improved transit efficiency."
