    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as a significant portion of income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Bridgeport have limited discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Bridgeport has decent access to public transportation, with several bus lines and proximity to the CTA Red Line. However, driving is also common, and any policy that significantly increases driving costs could be burdensome.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to maintain affordability. The focus is on balancing cost with improved transit times to enhance accessibility without significantly impacting residents' budgets. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also improve transit times, are prioritized."
