    "disposable_income": "Albany Park is a diverse community with a mix of income levels. The median household income is slightly below the city average, indicating that residents may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Albany Park have moderate discretionary spending. They prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Albany Park has good access to public transit, with several CTA bus routes and the Brown Line serving the area. However, transit times are relatively long compared to driving, which may influence residents' preferences for faster transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income levels and reliance on public transit, proposals that lower transit fares and improve transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Proposals with moderate driver fees are considered to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced transit fares, improved transit times, and moderate driver fees, while keeping the sales tax at a manageable level."
