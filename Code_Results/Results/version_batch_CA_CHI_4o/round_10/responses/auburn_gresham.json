    "disposable_income": "Auburn Gresham has a median household income lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Auburn Gresham may prioritize essential spending over discretionary consumption due to limited disposable income.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for Auburn Gresham residents, with many relying on it for commuting to work and accessing services. Car ownership is lower than in more affluent areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve discretionary spending. However, improving transit service is important for accessibility, so some increase in tax or fees is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel time. The selected proposals balance these considerations by offering reduced travel times and reasonable costs."
