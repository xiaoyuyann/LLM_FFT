    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side is a relatively affluent area with a higher median income compared to other Chicago neighborhoods. Residents have a moderate to high level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents of the Near South Side have a significant amount of discretionary spending, which they allocate to dining, entertainment, and other leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The Near South Side has good access to public transportation, including several CTA train lines and bus routes. However, driving is also a common mode of transportation due to the proximity to downtown and major highways.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, the community can absorb slightly higher costs in fares and fees if it results in better transit services and reduced travel times. The community values efficient transportation options that reduce travel time, even if it means a slight increase in costs. Therefore, proposals that balance lower travel times with moderate costs are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending, but a moderate increase is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services."
