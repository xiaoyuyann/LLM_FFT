    "disposable_income": "Archer Heights is a middle-income community with a significant portion of residents working in blue-collar jobs. The community has a moderate level of disposable income, which means that any increase in transportation costs could impact their budget for other essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Archer Heights have limited discretionary spending. They prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Archer Heights has moderate access to public transit, with several bus routes and a nearby CTA Orange Line station. However, many residents rely on driving due to the convenience and time savings it offers. Improving transit times could encourage more residents to switch from driving to public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to choose policies that minimize additional financial burdens while improving transit accessibility. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage a shift from driving to public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Therefore, the selected policies prioritize lower fares and moderate driver fees to balance cost and service improvements."
