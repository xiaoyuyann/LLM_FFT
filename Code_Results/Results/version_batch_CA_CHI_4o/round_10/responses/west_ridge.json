    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a moderate level of disposable income, with a diverse population including middle-income families and a significant number of low-income households. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact the overall budget for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community's discretionary consumption is varied, with spending on essentials like housing, food, and education taking precedence. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "West Ridge has decent access to public transit, but travel times are relatively long compared to driving. Improving transit times could benefit many residents who rely on public transportation, but cost increases could be burdensome.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and the need to balance costs, the community would benefit from policies that reduce transit times without significantly increasing costs. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also improve transit times, are prioritized. The decision aims to balance improved transit service with affordability."
