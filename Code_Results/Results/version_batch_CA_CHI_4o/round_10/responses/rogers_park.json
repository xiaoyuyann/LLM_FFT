    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a diverse population with a mix of income levels. The median household income is slightly below the city average, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Rogers Park have varied spending habits, with a significant portion of income going towards housing, food, and transportation. There is a need to balance transportation costs with other essential expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Rogers Park is well-served by public transit, including the Red Line and several bus routes. However, travel times can be long, and there is a need to improve transit efficiency. Car ownership is moderate, and congestion can be an issue during peak hours.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep transit fares affordable while improving service efficiency. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is crucial. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. The balance between fare, tax, and driver fee is crucial to ensure affordability and improved service."
