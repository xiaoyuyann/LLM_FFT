    "disposable_income": "Woodlawn has a moderate to low average disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary spending is limited, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact residents' ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Woodlawn has access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and reliability could greatly benefit the community, especially for those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income in Woodlawn, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve discretionary spending. However, improving transit times is crucial, so some trade-offs with slightly higher fares or fees are acceptable if they result in significantly better transit service. The selected policies balance affordability with improved transit accessibility, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and limited discretionary income."
