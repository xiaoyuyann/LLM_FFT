    "disposable_income": "The Lower West Side has a moderate level of disposable income, with many residents working in service and manufacturing sectors. The community is diverse, with a significant portion of the population being working-class families.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents of the Lower West Side tend to have limited discretionary spending due to moderate income levels. Essential expenses such as housing, food, and transportation take up a significant portion of their budget.",
    "accessibility": "The Lower West Side has decent access to public transportation, with several bus routes and train lines serving the area. However, travel times can be lengthy, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial. Car ownership is moderate, with some residents relying on driving for work and errands.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to keep costs low for both transit and driving. However, improving transit efficiency is also important to reduce travel times. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage more residents to use public transportation, reducing congestion and emissions. A balanced approach with a moderate sales tax can ensure better transit services without significantly impacting residents' budgets. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, along with a reasonable sales tax, are prioritized."
