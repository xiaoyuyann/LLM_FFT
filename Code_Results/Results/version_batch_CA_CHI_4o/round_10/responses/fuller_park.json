    "disposable_income": "Fuller Park is one of the lower-income areas in Chicago, with a median household income significantly below the city average. Residents have limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Fuller Park has limited access to public transportation options, and many residents rely on driving. Improving transit accessibility and reducing travel times could benefit the community, but cost increases must be minimized.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that minimize costs for residents while improving transit times. Lower fares and taxes are preferred to reduce the financial burden. Policies that slightly increase driving fees are acceptable if they significantly improve transit times, as this could encourage a shift to public transportation, reducing congestion and emissions. The focus is on balancing affordability with improved accessibility and service quality."
