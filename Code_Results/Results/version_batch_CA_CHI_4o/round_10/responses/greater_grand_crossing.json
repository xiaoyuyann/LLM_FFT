    "disposable_income": "Greater Grand Crossing has a median household income lower than the city average, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, leaving less room for discretionary consumption.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current transit times are long, and car ownership is lower than in other areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. However, improving transit times is also crucial to enhance accessibility. A balance between affordable costs and improved transit services is necessary. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' consumption of essential goods."
