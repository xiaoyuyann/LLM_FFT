    "disposable_income": "Belmont Cragin is a middle-income community with a significant portion of residents working in blue-collar jobs. The community has a moderate level of disposable income, which means that any increase in transportation costs could impact their budget for other essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Belmont Cragin have limited discretionary spending due to their income levels. They prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Belmont Cragin has moderate access to public transit, with some residents relying on buses and trains for commuting. Car ownership is also common, but traffic congestion can be an issue. Improving transit times and reducing congestion would benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on balancing costs with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability while reducing congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing travel times and maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers."
