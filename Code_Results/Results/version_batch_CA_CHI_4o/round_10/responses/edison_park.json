    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher disposable income, residents of Edison Park have a higher level of discretionary consumption. They are likely to prioritize convenience and time savings over cost savings, but they are also sensitive to significant increases in costs that could impact their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Edison Park has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban nature of the area. Reducing travel time by car and improving transit services could be beneficial, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost with improved service and reduced travel times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reduced travel times and reasonable costs, reflecting the community's preference for efficiency and convenience."
