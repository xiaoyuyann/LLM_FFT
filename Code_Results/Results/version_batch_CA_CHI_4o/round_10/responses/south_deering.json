    "disposable_income": "South Deering has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "South Deering has limited access to public transit options, making it crucial to improve transit services to reduce travel times and increase accessibility to jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, it is important to keep transit fares and driving fees low to minimize the financial burden on residents. However, improving transit times is also crucial to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents' discretionary spending. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and maintaining affordable costs."
