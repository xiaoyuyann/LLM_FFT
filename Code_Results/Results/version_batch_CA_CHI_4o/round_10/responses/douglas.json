    "disposable_income": "Douglas has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as a significant portion of income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption in Douglas is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact the ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Douglas has decent access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times by transit are relatively long compared to driving, which may discourage transit use if costs increase significantly.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary consumption, it is crucial to keep transportation costs low while improving transit efficiency. A lower fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs to improve accessibility and encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can also help reduce congestion and emissions."
