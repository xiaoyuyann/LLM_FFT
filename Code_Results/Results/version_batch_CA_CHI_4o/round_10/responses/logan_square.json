    "disposable_income": "Logan Square has a diverse population with a mix of income levels. The area has seen gentrification, leading to an increase in average income, but there remains a significant portion of residents with lower disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Logan Square have varied discretionary spending habits, with some prioritizing dining and entertainment due to the vibrant local scene, while others focus on essentials due to tighter budgets.",
    "accessibility": "Logan Square is well-served by public transit, including the Blue Line and several bus routes, making it accessible for those who rely on transit. However, car ownership is also common, and driving is a viable option for many.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the mixed income levels, it's important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to ensure accessibility for lower-income residents while still enhancing transit services. Reducing car travel time is also beneficial, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized, as they offer a good balance of affordability and improved transit times."
