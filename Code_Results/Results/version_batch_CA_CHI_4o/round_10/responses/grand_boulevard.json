    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are more sensitive to changes in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents in Grand Boulevard, as car ownership is lower than the city average. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are important for accessibility to jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transit and sensitivity to cost, the priority is to select policies that minimize fare increases while improving transit times. A lower sales tax is preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. Driver fees are acceptable if they lead to significant improvements in transit times, as they may encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The selected policies balance these factors by offering improved transit times with minimal fare increases and reasonable driver fees, while keeping the sales tax at a manageable level."
