    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and non-essential goods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on housing, food, and transportation being significant. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on other discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "Garfield Ridge has moderate accessibility to public transit, with some reliance on driving due to the community's layout and distance from central transit hubs. Reducing travel time and improving transit services could benefit the community, but cost increases must be carefully considered.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on balancing cost with improved service. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing travel time and maintaining or lowering costs, especially for transit users, while considering the impact on drivers."
