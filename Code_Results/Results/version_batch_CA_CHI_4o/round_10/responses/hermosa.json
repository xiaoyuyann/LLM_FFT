    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential expenses such as housing, food, and education, with less room for luxury or non-essential spending.",
    "accessibility": "Hermosa has moderate access to public transportation, with some reliance on buses and trains. Car ownership is common, but not universal, and many residents depend on public transit for commuting to work and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision-making process for Hermosa focuses on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to ensure affordability for residents who rely on public transportation. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can benefit the community by reducing travel times and improving accessibility. The goal is to select policies that enhance transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for residents."
