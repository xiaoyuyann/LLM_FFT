    "disposable_income": "Washington Park has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are more sensitive to changes in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited disposable income, residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Washington Park has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could greatly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. Therefore, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' discretionary spending."
