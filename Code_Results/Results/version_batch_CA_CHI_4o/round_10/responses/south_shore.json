    "disposable_income": "South Shore has a moderate to low average disposable income, with many residents relying on public transportation for commuting. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can significantly impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption in South Shore is limited, with residents prioritizing essential expenses. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce spending on other necessary goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "South Shore has decent access to public transportation, but travel times are relatively long. Improving transit efficiency and reducing travel times would greatly benefit the community, especially if it can be achieved without significantly increasing costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transportation and sensitivity to cost changes, the priority is to select policies that reduce travel time and maintain or lower costs. A lower fare and moderate driver fee can encourage more people to use transit, potentially reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and service improvement, considering the community's financial constraints and need for efficient transportation."
