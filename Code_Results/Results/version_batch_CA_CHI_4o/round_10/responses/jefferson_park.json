    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The community has a relatively stable economic base, with many residents employed in public service, healthcare, and education sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jefferson Park have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on housing, education, and local services. The community values affordability and cost-effectiveness in transportation options.",
    "accessibility": "Jefferson Park is well-served by public transit, including the CTA Blue Line, Metra, and several bus routes. It is also a car-friendly area with access to major highways. However, transit times can be lengthy, and there is a need for improved efficiency.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and focus on affordability, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred. The community values efficient transit options to reduce travel time, which can enhance accessibility to employment and services. Balancing the cost of transit and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel time and improved transit services is crucial. Proposals that offer a reasonable trade-off between cost and service improvement are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit efficiency, as this can lead to long-term savings and environmental benefits."
