    "disposable_income": "The Near North Side is one of the more affluent areas in Chicago, with a higher average disposable income compared to other communities. Residents can generally afford higher costs associated with transportation, but they still value cost-effectiveness.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Near North Side have a high level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and luxury goods. They are likely to be sensitive to changes in disposable income that affect their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "The Near North Side has excellent access to public transportation, with multiple transit lines and bus routes. However, traffic congestion can be an issue, making efficient transit options appealing.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community can handle moderate increases in taxes and fees if it results in significantly improved transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency. Proposals with higher driver fees are acceptable if they lead to reduced congestion and faster transit times. A balance between fare, tax, and driver fees is crucial to maintain affordability while enhancing service quality."
