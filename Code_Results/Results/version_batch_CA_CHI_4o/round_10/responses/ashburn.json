    "disposable_income": "Ashburn is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on housing, food, and other essentials taking priority. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Ashburn has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a viable option for many residents, but improvements in transit times and reliability could enhance accessibility. Car ownership is common, but reducing congestion and travel times is a priority.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance the budget impact and improve transit service. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while considering the impact of sales tax on disposable income."
