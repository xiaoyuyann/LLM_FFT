    "disposable_income": "Washington Heights has a moderate to low average disposable income, with many residents relying on public transportation for commuting. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can significantly impact their overall budget.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community's discretionary consumption is limited, with a significant portion of income allocated to essential expenses such as housing, food, and transportation. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce the ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Washington Heights has decent access to public transportation, but travel times are relatively long. Improving transit efficiency and reducing travel times would greatly benefit the community, especially if it can be achieved without significantly increasing costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transportation and sensitivity to cost changes, the priority is to select policies that improve transit efficiency and reduce travel times without imposing high costs. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and service improvement."
