    "disposable_income": "South Chicago has a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago, which means residents are more sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "South Chicago has moderate access to public transit, but travel times are longer compared to driving. Improving transit times could make public transportation a more viable option for residents, potentially reducing reliance on cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision focuses on minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and driver fees are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The goal is to balance affordability with improved accessibility, encouraging a shift from driving to transit where possible."
