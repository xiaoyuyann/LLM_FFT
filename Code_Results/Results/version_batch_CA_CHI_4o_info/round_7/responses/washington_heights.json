    "disposable_income": "The median income in Washington Heights is $66,797, with a per capita income of $29,673. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a considerable percentage of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. The community would be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees, as these would reduce disposable income for other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "58.2% of residents drive alone, while 22.3% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 83.2% of households owning at least one vehicle. However, a significant portion of the population relies on transit, indicating the importance of maintaining affordable and efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, the ideal policy would balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax would support transit improvements without significantly impacting discretionary spending. The selected policies prioritize reducing travel time and maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers."
