    "disposable_income": "Albany Park has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of households earning between $25,000 and $149,999. The community has a relatively balanced income distribution, with a notable percentage of higher-income households ($100,000+). This suggests a moderate to high level of disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many households in Albany Park likely have discretionary income to spend on non-essential goods and services. However, a portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating that affordability of transportation options is crucial for these residents.",
    "accessibility": "Albany Park has a diverse mode of transportation usage, with a significant portion of residents using transit (23.7%) and driving alone (45.5%). The community also has a notable percentage of households without a vehicle (19.1%), highlighting the importance of affordable and efficient public transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering Albany Park's diverse income levels and significant reliance on both transit and driving, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use while reducing congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower transit fares and moderate driver fees to improve accessibility and reduce travel times, while considering the impact on discretionary income."
