    "disposable_income": "The median income in Pullman is $54,755, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests that disposable income is limited for many residents, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $32,327, residents may prioritize essential spending over discretionary consumption. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are likely to be preferred.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the population (64%) drives alone, while 17.6% use transit. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability could benefit those reliant on public transportation, while also considering the impact on drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance affordability with improved transit services are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times for both modes while keeping costs manageable for residents."
