    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon has a median household income of $64,441, with a significant portion of households earning between $25,000 and $74,999. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with some households potentially sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many households may prioritize essential spending over discretionary consumption. Therefore, policies that minimize additional financial burdens are likely to be favored.",
    "accessibility": "With 59.6% of residents driving alone and 12.9% using transit, accessibility improvements for both modes are important. The community has a mean commute time of 36.3 minutes, indicating a need for efficient transportation options.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance cost and accessibility improvements. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden households. The goal is to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, while supporting transit improvements through reasonable funding mechanisms."
