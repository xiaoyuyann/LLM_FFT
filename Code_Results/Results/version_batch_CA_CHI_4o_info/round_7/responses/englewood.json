    "disposable_income": "Englewood has a low median income of $27,792 and a per capita income of $17,897. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A large portion of the population relies on transit (25.2%) and a significant number have no vehicle (44.6%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low income levels, minimizing costs is essential. A lower transit fare and driver fee are prioritized to reduce financial burden. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel time is also important to improve access to jobs and services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate taxes, and reduced travel times are prioritized."
