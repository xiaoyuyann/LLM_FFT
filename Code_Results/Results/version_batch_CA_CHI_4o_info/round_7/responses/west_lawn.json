    "discretionary_consumption": "With 36.9% of households earning less than $50,000, there is a need to balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "63.4% of residents drive alone, while only 9.8% use transit. This suggests a reliance on cars, but there is potential to improve transit usage with better services. Car ownership is high, with 56.3% owning two or more vehicles, indicating a need for policies that do not overly penalize drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income levels and reliance on driving, policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with reasonable travel times are preferred. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The goal is to improve transit accessibility without significantly increasing costs for drivers or reducing disposable income through high taxes."
