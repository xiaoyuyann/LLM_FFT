    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a median income of $72,159 and a per capita income of $38,718. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Bridgeport has a relatively high percentage of residents who drive alone (48.3%) and a notable portion using transit (16%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordability could benefit a significant portion of the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to enhance transit accessibility while considering the financial constraints of the community."
