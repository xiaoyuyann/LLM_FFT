    "disposable_income": "West Town has a high median income of $128,717 and a per capita income of $82,088, indicating a relatively affluent community with significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 43.9% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has a high capacity for discretionary spending. However, a significant portion of the population (17.1%) earns less than $50,000, which should be considered when evaluating the impact of increased costs.",
    "accessibility": "West Town has a diverse mode of transportation usage with 23.2% using transit and 35.1% driving alone. The community also has a high percentage of residents working from home (26.3%), which may reduce the overall impact of transportation costs. Car ownership is moderate, with 20.2% of households having no vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can absorb moderate increases in taxes and fees. However, the significant use of transit suggests that lower transit fares would benefit a large portion of the population. The goal is to balance improved transit services with reasonable costs. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while maintaining a manageable tax rate to support transit improvements."
