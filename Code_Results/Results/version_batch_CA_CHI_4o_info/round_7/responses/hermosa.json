    "discretionary_consumption": "With 14.9% of households earning less than $25,000 and 23.1% earning between $25,000 and $49,999, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, impacting their discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "60.9% of residents drive alone, while 17.7% use transit. Car ownership is high, with only 12.5% of households without a vehicle. This suggests a reliance on both driving and transit, with a need for efficient and affordable options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower fares and moderate driver fees with reasonable travel times are prioritized. Lower sales taxes are preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The community benefits from reduced travel times, especially for transit, to improve accessibility and encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
