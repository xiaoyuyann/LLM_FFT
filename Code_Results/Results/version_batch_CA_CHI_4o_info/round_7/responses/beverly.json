    "disposable_income": "Beverly has a high median income of $131,170 and a per capita income of $64,719, indicating a relatively high level of disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of households earning over $150,000, the community likely has a higher capacity for discretionary spending. However, the community may still be sensitive to changes in costs that affect their overall budget.",
    "accessibility": "62% of residents drive alone, and 17% use transit. The community has a high car ownership rate, with 43.6% owning two vehicles and 15.4% owning three or more. This suggests a strong reliance on personal vehicles, but a notable portion also relies on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, the community can absorb moderate increases in costs if they lead to significant improvements in transit service. The goal is to balance the cost of living with improved transit times and reduced congestion. Proposals with higher driver fees and moderate transit fares are preferred to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between cost and improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both driving and transit."
