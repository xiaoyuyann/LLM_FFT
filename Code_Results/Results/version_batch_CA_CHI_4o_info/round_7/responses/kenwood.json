    "disposable_income": "Kenwood has a median income of $58,052 and a per capita income of $55,311. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, which suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.4% of households earning less than $25,000, a large portion of the community may have limited discretionary spending. Therefore, policies that minimize additional costs are likely to be more favorable.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has a high percentage of residents using transit (23.1%) and a significant portion without vehicles (33.1%). This indicates a reliance on public transportation, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transit and the need to keep costs low for lower-income residents, the top priority is to reduce transit fares while maintaining or improving service efficiency. A lower sales tax is also preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The ranked proposals reflect a balance between reducing costs and improving transit times, with a preference for lower fares and moderate driver fees to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
