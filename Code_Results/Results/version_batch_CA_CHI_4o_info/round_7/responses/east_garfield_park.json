    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are preferred to minimize financial burden. Reducing transit times is also important to improve accessibility. A balance between fare, tax, and driving fees is crucial to ensure affordability and improved transit services. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driving fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting the community's accessibility and financial situation."
