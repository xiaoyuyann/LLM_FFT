    "disposable_income": "Dunning has a relatively high percentage of households earning $100,000 or more (41.1%), indicating a moderate to high disposable income level. However, there is also a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000 (29.3%), suggesting income diversity.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of the population in higher income brackets, discretionary spending is likely robust. However, the presence of lower-income households means that affordability of transportation options remains important.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (72.1%), indicating a strong reliance on personal vehicles. Only 7.3% use transit, suggesting that current transit options may not be as accessible or convenient. Car ownership is high, with 93.7% of households owning at least one vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and costs are favorable. However, improving transit accessibility and affordability is also important to support lower-income residents and reduce congestion. A balance between low transit fares and moderate driver fees is ideal. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized."
