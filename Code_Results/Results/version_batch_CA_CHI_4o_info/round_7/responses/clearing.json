    "disposable_income": "The median household income in Clearing is $73,778, with a per capita income of $33,089. A significant portion of the population earns between $50,000 and $149,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 22% of households earning between $100,000 and $149,999 and 15.7% earning over $150,000, there is a reasonable level of discretionary consumption. However, 32.8% of households earn less than $50,000, suggesting that affordability is a concern for a substantial segment of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (74.1%) drive alone, indicating a high reliance on personal vehicles. Only 6.9% use transit, and 8% of households have no vehicle. The mean commute time is 31.9 minutes, suggesting moderate accessibility challenges.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and costs are favorable. However, with a notable portion of the population using transit and a significant number of low-income households, affordable transit options are also important. Balancing these needs, proposals with moderate taxes and fees that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs are prioritized. Proposals that reduce driving time while maintaining or slightly improving transit times are preferred, as they benefit the majority who drive while still supporting transit users."
