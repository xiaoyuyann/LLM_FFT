    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen has a high median income of $139,046 and a per capita income of $70,693, indicating a relatively high level of disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 46.5% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has significant discretionary spending power. However, a portion of the population (18.3%) earns less than $50,000, which should be considered when evaluating the impact of increased costs.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (57.9%) drive alone, with only 10.5% using transit. Car ownership is high, with 62.3% of households owning two or more vehicles. This suggests that while transit improvements are beneficial, policies should not overly burden drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and preference for driving, policies that significantly increase driving costs may not be well-received. However, improving transit times could encourage more transit use, benefiting those who rely on it. Balancing lower transit fares with moderate driver fees and sales taxes can enhance transit services without overly burdening drivers or low-income residents. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times for both modes while maintaining affordability."
