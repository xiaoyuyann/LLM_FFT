    "disposable_income": "The median income in Hegewisch is $58,647, with a per capita income of $31,457. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.6% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees, as these could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "65.2% of residents drive alone, while only 10.8% use transit. This suggests a reliance on cars, but also a potential for increased transit use if services improve. Car ownership is high, with 87.4% of households owning at least one vehicle, indicating that driving is a primary mode of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on driving, policies that minimize costs while improving transit times are preferred. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden low-income households. The goal is to balance affordability with improved transit accessibility and reduced congestion."
