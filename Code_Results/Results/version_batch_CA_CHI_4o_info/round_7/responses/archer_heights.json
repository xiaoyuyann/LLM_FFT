    "disposable_income": "The community has a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000, with 46.3% of households falling into this category. This suggests that disposable income is limited for a large segment of the population.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, discretionary spending is likely constrained, with a focus on essential goods and services. The community may be sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as fares and fees.",
    "accessibility": "A majority of residents drive alone (58.7%) or carpool (19.4%), with only 13.1% using transit. This indicates a reliance on cars, but a notable portion still depends on public transit. Accessibility improvements in transit could benefit those without vehicles (23.7% of households).",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes minimizing costs for both transit users and drivers while improving transit times. Lower fares and driver fees are preferred to accommodate the community's limited disposable income. Proposals with moderate sales tax rates are chosen to balance funding for transit improvements without overly burdening residents. The focus is on reducing travel times for both modes to enhance accessibility and efficiency."
