    "disposable_income": "Avondale has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of households earning above $100,000, indicating a relatively high disposable income for many residents. However, there is also a notable percentage of households earning less than $50,000, which suggests that affordability is a concern for a portion of the community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a mix of income levels, discretionary consumption varies. Higher-income households may have more flexibility in spending, while lower-income households may prioritize essential expenses. The community's spending on transportation should consider both affordability and the potential for improved services.",
    "accessibility": "Avondale has a substantial percentage of residents using transit (21.5%) and a significant number driving alone (49.7%). The community's accessibility to resources and services is influenced by both transit and driving options. Improving transit times and maintaining reasonable costs are important for enhancing accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income diversity and reliance on both transit and driving, the policy proposals should balance affordability with improved service. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while considering the community's income distribution and transportation preferences."
