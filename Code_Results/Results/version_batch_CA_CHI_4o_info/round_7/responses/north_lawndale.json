    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has a relatively low median income of $33,334 and a per capita income of $21,201. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A large portion of the community relies on driving alone (57.3%) and transit (23.7%) for commuting. Car ownership is moderate, with 36.5% of households having no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit for many residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that minimize costs while improving transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance affordability and service improvement. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times for both drivers and transit users while keeping costs manageable for the community."
