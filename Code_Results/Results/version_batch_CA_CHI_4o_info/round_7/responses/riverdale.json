    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has a median income of $41,144 and a per capita income of $19,721. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "67.9% of residents drive alone, while 12.9% use transit. The mean commute time is 33.8 minutes. Improving transit times could benefit those who rely on public transportation, but the majority still drive.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, policies with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize financial strain. However, improving transit times is also important for those who rely on it. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, and reasonable driving fees that improve transit times, are prioritized."
