    "disposable_income": "Portage Park has a median income of $85,473 and a per capita income of $38,488. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a substantial portion of the population earning over $100,000, there is likely a higher level of discretionary consumption. However, 30.8% of households earn less than $50,000, indicating a need to balance affordability for lower-income residents.",
    "accessibility": "62.9% of residents drive alone, and 14% use transit. The mean commute time is 37.1 minutes, suggesting a reliance on both driving and transit. Improving transit times could benefit a significant portion of the community, but driving remains the dominant mode.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and cost are favorable. However, improving transit times and maintaining affordability for lower-income residents is also crucial. A balance between lower fares, moderate taxes, and driver fees that encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers is ideal. Policies that significantly reduce transit times while keeping fares low and taxes moderate are prioritized. The community's relatively high income allows for some flexibility in accepting higher taxes if it results in better services."
