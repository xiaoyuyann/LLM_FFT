    "discretionary_consumption": "With 26.7% of households earning between $25,000 and $49,999, and 15.1% earning less than $25,000, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their discretionary spending on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (68.4%) drive alone, with only 7.7% using transit. The mean commute time is 36.4 minutes, suggesting that improvements in transit could benefit a small but significant portion of the community, while maintaining reasonable driving times is crucial for the majority.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on driving and moderate income levels, policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with minimal tax increases are preferred. This approach aims to improve transit times and accessibility without significantly impacting disposable income. The focus is on reducing travel times for both drivers and transit users while keeping costs manageable for households with limited discretionary income."
