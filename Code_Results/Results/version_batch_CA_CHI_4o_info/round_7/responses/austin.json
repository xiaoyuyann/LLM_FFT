    "disposable_income": "The median income in Austin is $40,086, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "Austin has a relatively high transit usage at 23.7%, but also a significant portion of residents drive alone (56.9%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial to support those who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized to ensure affordability. Driver fees are considered to reduce congestion and improve transit times, but they should not be too high to avoid burdening drivers. The selected policies aim to balance these factors, improving transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents."
