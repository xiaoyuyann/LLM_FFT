    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can afford moderate increases in taxes and fees if they result in improved transit services. However, the high percentage of households without vehicles and those using transit suggests prioritizing policies that enhance transit efficiency and affordability. Balancing lower fares with moderate taxes and driver fees can improve transit times and reduce congestion, benefiting both transit users and drivers. The selected policies aim to optimize transit times while maintaining reasonable costs for both transit users and drivers, considering the community's income distribution and transportation preferences."
