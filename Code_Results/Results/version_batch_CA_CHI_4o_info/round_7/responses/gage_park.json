    "disposable_income": "The median income in Gage Park is $50,112, with a per capita income of $19,524. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49.9% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "59.6% of residents drive alone, while 17.9% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, but 20.5% of households have no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit for a portion of the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and the reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial strain while encouraging transit use. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as it spreads the cost across all consumers rather than just transit users. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, enhancing overall accessibility without imposing excessive financial burdens."
