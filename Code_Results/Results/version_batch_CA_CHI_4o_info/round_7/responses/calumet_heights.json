    "disposable_income": "The median income in Calumet Heights is $68,436, with a per capita income of $39,867. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their ability to spend on other necessities and discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "52.3% of residents drive alone, while 19.5% use transit. A significant portion of the community relies on cars, but a notable percentage also depends on public transit, indicating the need for balanced improvements in both areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve accessibility. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and lower sales taxes are prioritized."
