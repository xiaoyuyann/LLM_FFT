    "disposable_income": "Belmont Cragin has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of households earning below $50,000. This suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of households in lower income brackets, discretionary spending is likely limited. Therefore, policies that minimize additional costs are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "A majority of residents drive alone, but a notable portion also uses transit. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability could benefit those who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the income distribution, minimizing costs while improving transit times is crucial. A lower fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to balance these factors, improving transit times and reducing congestion while keeping costs manageable for residents."
