    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a median income of $57,591 and a per capita income of $36,162. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 44.8% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact these households.",
    "accessibility": "Rogers Park has a high percentage of residents using transit (28.1%) and a significant portion without vehicles (37.2%). This suggests a strong reliance on public transportation, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Proposals with a balance of lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting both transit users and drivers."
