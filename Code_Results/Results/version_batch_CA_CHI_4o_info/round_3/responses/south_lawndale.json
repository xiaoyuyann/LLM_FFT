    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a median household income of $42,010 and a per capita income of $18,001, indicating limited disposable income. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, suggesting that affordability is a key concern.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large portion of the community earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely limited. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "56.5% of residents drive alone, while 15.3% use transit. The community has a moderate reliance on transit, but a significant number of households do not own a vehicle, indicating the importance of affordable and efficient public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the ideal policy would balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit efficiency. The selected policies aim to reduce travel time and costs for both drivers and transit users, while considering the community's financial constraints."
