    "disposable_income": "Washington Park has a median income of $26,014 and a per capita income of $19,948. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With nearly half of the population earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "42.8% of households do not own a vehicle, and 32.3% of the population relies on transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community. The mean commute time is 38.4 minutes, indicating a need for efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing transit time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Proposals with a balance of lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting both transit users and drivers."
