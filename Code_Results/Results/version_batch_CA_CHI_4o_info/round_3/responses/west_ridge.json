    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a median income of $68,091 and a per capita income of $32,132. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "59.2% of residents drive alone, while 12.5% use transit. Improving transit times and affordability could encourage more residents to switch from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and current transportation habits, the focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it results in better transit services. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, while considering the community's financial constraints."
