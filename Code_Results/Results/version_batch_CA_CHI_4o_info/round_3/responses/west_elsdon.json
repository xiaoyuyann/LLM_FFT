    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon has a median household income of $64,441, with a significant portion of the population earning between $25,000 and $74,999. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with some households potentially sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, a large portion of the community may prioritize affordability in transportation to maintain their current level of discretionary consumption. The community might be sensitive to increases in sales tax and transportation costs that could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "With 59.6% of residents driving alone and 12.9% using transit, accessibility improvements in transit could benefit a significant portion of the community. However, the high car ownership rate suggests that policies should also consider the needs of drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden households. The goal is to reduce travel times and improve transit accessibility while maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers."
