    "disposable_income": "The median income in Douglas is $43,528, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 34.8% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "44.4% of households do not own a vehicle, and 26.4% of residents use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community, as many rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, policies that reduce transit fares and maintain low taxes are prioritized. Additionally, policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs are preferred. The community's high percentage of non-vehicle households and transit users suggests that enhancing transit services while keeping costs low is essential. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes, which also improve transit times, are ranked higher."
