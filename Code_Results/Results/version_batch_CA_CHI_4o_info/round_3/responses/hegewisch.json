    "disposable_income": "The median income in Hegewisch is $58,647, with a per capita income of $31,457. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.6% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees, as these could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "65.2% of residents drive alone, while only 10.8% use transit. This suggests a reliance on cars, but also a potential for increased transit use if services improve. The community has a moderate level of car ownership, with 12.6% having no vehicle, indicating a need for affordable and efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on driving, policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with reasonable travel times are preferred. A lower sales tax is also favorable to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The goal is to improve transit accessibility without significantly increasing costs for residents who rely on driving."
