    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Shore is $39,649, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the population relies on transit (32.8%) and a notable percentage has no vehicle (37.8%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. The community would benefit from reduced travel times and improved transit services, but not at the expense of high fares or taxes. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit without significantly increasing costs, are preferred. The tradeoff between fare, tax, and driver fee is balanced to ensure affordability and improved service."
