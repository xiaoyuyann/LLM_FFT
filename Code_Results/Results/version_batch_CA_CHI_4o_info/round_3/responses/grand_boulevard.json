    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on transit (21.4%) and a notable percentage has no vehicle (30.3%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial, while also considering the impact on those who drive.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on transit, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility. The top-ranked policies balance affordability with improved transit services, considering both transit users and drivers. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel time and congestion, benefiting the community overall."
