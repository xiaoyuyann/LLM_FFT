    "disposable_income": "The Near West Side has a relatively high median income of $106,955 and a per capita income of $72,602. A significant portion of the population earns over $150,000, indicating a community with substantial disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, the community likely has a higher level of discretionary consumption. However, 17.9% of the population earns less than $25,000, suggesting that affordability of transit fares and fees is still a concern for a portion of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a diverse mode of transportation usage with 18.1% using transit and 24.1% walking or biking. Car ownership is moderate, with 34.3% of households having no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit and non-motorized transport.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in better transit services. The community's reliance on transit and non-motorized transport suggests a preference for policies that improve transit efficiency and reduce travel time. A balance between fare affordability and improved transit service is crucial. Policies with higher driver fees could reduce congestion and emissions, benefiting the community's transit users. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax, lower transit fares, and higher driver fees are prioritized to enhance transit service while maintaining affordability for lower-income residents."
