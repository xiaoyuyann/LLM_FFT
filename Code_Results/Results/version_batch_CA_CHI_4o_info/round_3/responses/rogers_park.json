    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a median income of $57,591 and a per capita income of $36,162. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 44.8% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact these households' budgets.",
    "accessibility": "Rogers Park has a high reliance on public transit (28.1%) and a significant portion of households without vehicles (37.2%). Accessibility to affordable and efficient transit is crucial for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to maintain affordability and improve transit efficiency. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The goal is to balance affordability with improved transit times, benefiting both transit users and drivers by reducing congestion."
