    "disposable_income": "The median income in Calumet Heights is $68,436, with a per capita income of $39,867. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 20.6% of households earning less than $25,000, there is a need to minimize additional financial burdens from transportation costs. The community's spending on goods and services could be impacted by higher taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "52.3% of residents drive alone, while 19.5% use transit. Improving transit times could benefit a significant portion of the community, but affordability remains crucial. Car ownership is moderate, with 19.4% having no vehicle, indicating reliance on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without imposing high costs. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, benefiting those who rely on public transportation. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times while maintaining affordability, considering the community's income constraints and transportation needs."
