    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a central business district with a mix of high-income professionals and lower-income service workers. Disposable income varies significantly, but generally, there is a higher average income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Loop have a higher level of discretionary consumption due to the presence of numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options. However, the cost of living is also high.",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent accessibility to resources and services, with extensive public transit options including buses and trains. Walking and biking are also viable options due to the dense urban environment.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high accessibility to public transit and the mixed income levels, the focus is on maintaining or improving transit services while considering the financial impact on residents. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The goal is to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency and reduced travel times."
