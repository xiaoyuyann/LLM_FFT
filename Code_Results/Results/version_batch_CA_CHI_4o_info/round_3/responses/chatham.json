    "discretionary_consumption": "With 32.8% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact these households.",
    "accessibility": "31.8% of households have no vehicle, and 27.3% of residents use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and limited disposable income, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Balancing fare, tax, and driving fees to improve transit service while maintaining affordability is key."
