    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Chicago is $43,936, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $22,912, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "31.6% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% of residents use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community, as a significant portion relies on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized. A lower sales tax is also preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The goal is to enhance transit accessibility while keeping costs manageable for residents. Policies that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are also considered to improve overall accessibility and efficiency."
