    "disposable_income": "The median income in Washington Heights is $66,797, with a per capita income of $29,673. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a considerable percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could impact spending on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "58.2% of residents drive alone, while 22.3% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 83.2% of households owning at least one vehicle. However, 16.8% of households have no vehicle, relying on transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit services are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it enhances transit services, benefiting those without vehicles. The selected policies aim to reduce travel time and costs while considering the community's financial constraints."
