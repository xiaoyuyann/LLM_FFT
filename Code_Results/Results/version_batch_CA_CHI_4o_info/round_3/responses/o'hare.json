    "disposable_income": "O'Hare is a mixed-income area with a range of income levels, but generally has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to the airport and associated employment opportunities.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in O'Hare likely have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on housing, transportation, and leisure activities given the area's connectivity and amenities.",
    "accessibility": "O'Hare has good accessibility to resources and services, with strong transit links due to the airport and major highways, making both driving and public transit viable options for residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares or driving fees if it results in better services. However, a high sales tax could impact discretionary spending negatively. The community benefits from reduced congestion and improved transit times, so policies that balance these factors are preferred. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while keeping the sales tax at a manageable level to not overly burden residents' discretionary spending."
