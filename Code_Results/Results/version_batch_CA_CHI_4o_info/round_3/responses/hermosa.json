Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A balance between fare, tax, and driver fees is crucial to maintain affordability and improve service quality. The selected policies aim to optimize travel time and cost for both drivers and transit users, while considering the community's income constraints and transportation habits."
