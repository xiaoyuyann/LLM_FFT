    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Deering is $34,814, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on driving (57.2%) and transit (23.7%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (24%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance affordability with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to improve transit efficiency while considering the financial constraints of the community."
