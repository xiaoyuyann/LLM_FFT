    "disposable_income": "The median income is $69,810, with a per capita income of $36,151. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 18.4% earning less than $25,000 and 19.3% earning between $25,000 and $49,999, a large segment of the community may have limited discretionary spending. Thus, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferable to maintain disposable income for other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "24.5% of the population uses transit, and 23.8% have no vehicle, highlighting the importance of affordable and efficient public transit. The community also has a significant number of people who drive alone (43.8%), so reducing driving time and costs is also beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both transit and driving, the ideal policy would balance lower costs with improved transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as it supports a large transit-dependent population. The selected policies aim to reduce travel time and costs for both transit users and drivers, while maintaining affordability."
