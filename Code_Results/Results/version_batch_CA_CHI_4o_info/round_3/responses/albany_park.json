    "disposable_income": "Albany Park has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of households earning between $25,000 and $149,999. The community has a relatively balanced income distribution, with a notable percentage of high-income households ($150,000+). This suggests a moderate to high level of disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many households in Albany Park likely have discretionary income to spend on non-essential goods and services. However, a portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating that affordability of transportation options is crucial for these residents.",
    "accessibility": "Albany Park has a high percentage of residents using transit (23.7%) and a significant number of households without a vehicle (19.1%). This indicates a strong reliance on public transportation. The community also has a substantial number of residents who drive alone (45.5%), suggesting that both transit and driving options are important for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the reliance on public transit and the need for affordable options, proposals with lower transit fares are prioritized. However, the community also values efficient transit services, so a balance between fare affordability and service quality is important. Proposals with moderate driver fees are considered to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The sales tax is kept moderate to ensure it does not overly burden residents' discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to improve transit efficiency while maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers."
