    "disposable_income": "Edison Park has a relatively high median income of $120,024 and a per capita income of $57,872. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high median income, residents likely have more discretionary spending power. However, a portion of the population (12.3%) earns less than $25,000, so affordability of transit fares and fees is still a consideration.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (69.1%) drive alone, indicating a reliance on cars. Only 8.4% use transit, suggesting that improvements in transit could benefit a small but significant portion of the community. Car ownership is high, with 61% owning two or more vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and costs are favorable. However, improving transit is also important for the minority who rely on it. A balance between low transit fares and moderate driver fees is ideal. Lower sales tax rates are preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The community's high income allows for some flexibility in accepting moderate fees for improved services."
