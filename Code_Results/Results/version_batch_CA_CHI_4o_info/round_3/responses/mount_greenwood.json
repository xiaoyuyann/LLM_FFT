    "disposable_income": "Mount Greenwood has a relatively high median income of $113,328 and a per capita income of $47,744. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning above $100,000, the community likely has a substantial amount of discretionary income. However, any increase in taxes or fees could impact their consumption patterns, especially for those in the lower income brackets.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (82.2%), with a small percentage using transit (4.2%). This suggests that car travel is the primary mode of transportation, and any policy that increases driving costs could have a significant impact. However, improving transit could encourage more residents to switch modes, potentially reducing congestion.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and reliance on driving, policies that significantly increase driving costs may not be favorable. However, improving transit times and services could benefit the community by providing viable alternatives to driving. Balancing the tax rate to ensure adequate funding for transit without overly burdening residents is crucial. Therefore, proposals with moderate taxes and fees, but improved transit times, are prioritized. The community's high income allows for some flexibility in absorbing costs, but minimizing impact on lower-income households is also important."
