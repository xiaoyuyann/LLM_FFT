    "disposable_income": "The median income in Avalon Park is $54,139, with a per capita income of $31,626. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 24% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact these households' ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "58.5% of residents drive alone, while 24.1% use transit. A substantial portion of the community relies on transit, but car ownership is also high, with 76.4% of households owning at least one vehicle. Accessibility improvements in transit could benefit a large segment of the population.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial strain while encouraging transit use. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could benefit the 24.1% of transit users and potentially reduce congestion for drivers."
