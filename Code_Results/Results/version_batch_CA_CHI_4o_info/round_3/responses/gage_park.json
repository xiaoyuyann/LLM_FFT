    "disposable_income": "The median income in Gage Park is $50,112, with a per capita income of $19,524. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49.9% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "59.6% of residents drive alone, while 17.9% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 79.5% of households owning at least one vehicle. However, 20.5% of households have no vehicle, relying on transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and the reliance on both driving and transit, policies that minimize costs while improving transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance affordability and service improvement. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times for both modes while keeping costs manageable for the community."
