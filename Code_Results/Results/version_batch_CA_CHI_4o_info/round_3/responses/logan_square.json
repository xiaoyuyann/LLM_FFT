    "disposable_income": "Logan Square has a relatively high median income of $97,759 and a per capita income of $62,532. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, residents likely have a higher capacity for discretionary spending. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, so affordability remains a concern for some households.",
    "accessibility": "Logan Square has a diverse mode of transportation usage with 26.5% using transit and 36.6% driving alone. The community has a significant number of households without vehicles (21.2%), indicating a reliance on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and the significant number of households without vehicles, policies that improve transit times and affordability are prioritized. A lower transit fare is beneficial for the community, especially for lower-income residents. However, the community's higher income levels allow for some flexibility in supporting higher taxes if it results in better services. The goal is to balance affordability with improved transit services and reduced congestion. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes and driving fees are preferred to enhance transit accessibility while maintaining reasonable costs for drivers."
