    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a median income of $72,159 and a per capita income of $38,718. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Bridgeport has a relatively high percentage of residents who drive alone (48.3%) and a notable portion using transit (16%). The community's car ownership is moderate, with 17.8% having no vehicle, suggesting a reliance on public transit for some residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, the ideal policy should balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax can support transit improvements without significantly impacting discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, enhancing overall accessibility."
