    "disposable_income": "Kenwood has a median income of $58,052 and a per capita income of $55,311. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, which suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.4% of households earning less than $25,000, a large portion of the community may have limited discretionary spending. Therefore, policies that minimize additional costs are likely to be favored.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has a high percentage of residents using transit (23.1%) and a significant portion without vehicles (33.1%). This indicates a reliance on public transportation, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the significant portion of low-income residents, policies that reduce transit fares and improve transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Driver fees are considered as a means to improve transit services and reduce congestion, but they should not overly burden those who drive. The selected policies balance these factors by offering reduced transit fares, moderate driver fees to encourage transit use, and manageable sales tax rates to support transit improvements."
