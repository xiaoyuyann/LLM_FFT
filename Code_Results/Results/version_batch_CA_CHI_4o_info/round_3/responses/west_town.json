    "disposable_income": "West Town has a high median income of $128,717 and a per capita income of $82,088, indicating a relatively affluent community with significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 43.9% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has a high capacity for discretionary spending. However, a significant portion of the population (9.8%) earns less than $25,000, suggesting some income disparity.",
    "accessibility": "West Town has a diverse mode of transportation usage with 23.2% using transit and 35.1% driving alone. The community also has a high percentage of residents working from home (26.3%), reducing daily commuting needs. Car ownership is moderate, with 20.2% of households having no vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can absorb moderate increases in taxes and fees. However, the presence of lower-income residents necessitates consideration of affordable transit options. The community values efficient transit, as evidenced by the significant transit usage. Therefore, proposals that improve transit times while maintaining reasonable costs are prioritized. A balance between transit fare, sales tax, and driving fees is crucial to ensure accessibility and affordability for all income levels. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driving fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion."
