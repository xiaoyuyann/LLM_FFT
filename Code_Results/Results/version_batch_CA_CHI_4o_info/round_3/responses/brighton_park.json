    "disposable_income": "The median income in Brighton Park is $52,145, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $22,361, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "58.8% of residents drive alone, while 15.1% use transit. Improving transit times and affordability could benefit a substantial portion of the community, especially those without vehicles (15.4%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income constraints and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as it supports the 15.1% transit users and could encourage more to switch from driving, reducing congestion and emissions."
