    "disposable_income": "Dunning has a relatively high percentage of households earning $100,000 or more (41.1%), indicating a moderate to high disposable income level. However, there is also a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000 (29.3%), suggesting income diversity.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of the population in higher income brackets, discretionary consumption is likely to be robust. However, the presence of lower-income households means that affordability of transportation options remains important.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (72.1%), indicating a strong reliance on personal vehicles. Only 7.3% use transit, suggesting that current transit accessibility may be limited or less convenient compared to driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and costs are favorable. However, improving transit options could benefit lower-income residents and reduce congestion. A balance between affordable transit fares and reasonable driving fees is crucial. Lower sales taxes are preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driving fees, which also improve transit times, are prioritized. The community's income diversity necessitates a careful balance between cost and service improvement."
