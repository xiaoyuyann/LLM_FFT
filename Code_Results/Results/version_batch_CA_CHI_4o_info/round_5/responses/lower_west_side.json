    "disposable_income": "The median income is $69,810, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with a need to balance costs carefully.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $36,151, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "24.5% of residents use transit, and 43.8% drive alone. A significant portion of the community relies on transit, so maintaining affordable and efficient transit options is crucial. Car ownership is moderate, with 23.8% having no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on transit and moderate income levels, policies that reduce transit fares and maintain reasonable driving fees are prioritized. Lower sales taxes are preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The goal is to improve transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for both transit users and drivers. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are favored to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting both transit users and drivers."
