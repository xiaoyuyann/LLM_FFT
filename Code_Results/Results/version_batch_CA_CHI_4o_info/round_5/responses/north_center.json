    "disposable_income": "North Center has a high median income of $148,585 and a per capita income of $88,926, indicating a relatively affluent community with significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49.5% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has a high capacity for discretionary spending. However, a significant portion of the population may still be sensitive to increased costs from taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "38.6% of residents drive alone, and 20% use transit, indicating a balanced reliance on both modes. The community has a high rate of car ownership, with 87.4% of households owning at least one vehicle, suggesting good accessibility by car. However, transit improvements could benefit the 20% who rely on it.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, the community can absorb moderate increases in taxes and fees. However, maintaining a balance between cost and service improvement is crucial. Proposals that reduce travel time significantly, especially for transit, are prioritized to enhance accessibility and encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The community's high car ownership and reliance on driving suggest that driver fees should be moderate to avoid excessive burden."
