    "disposable_income": "The median income in Avalon Park is $54,139, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests that the community may be sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as higher fares or driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $31,626, residents may have limited discretionary spending. Therefore, policies that minimize additional financial burdens while improving transit services would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on driving alone (58.5%) and transit (24.1%) for commuting. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares could enhance accessibility for those who depend on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on both driving and transit, and the sensitivity to cost increases, the ideal policy would balance lower fares and moderate driver fees to improve transit services without significantly increasing the financial burden. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The selected proposals aim to improve transit efficiency and accessibility while considering the community's economic constraints."
