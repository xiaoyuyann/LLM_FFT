    "disposable_income": "Lake View has a relatively high median income of $100,625 and a per capita income of $87,044. A significant portion of the population earns over $150,000, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, so affordability of transit and driving fees is still a consideration.",
    "accessibility": "Lake View has a high percentage of residents using transit (36.9%) and a significant portion without vehicle access (39.6%). This suggests a strong reliance on public transportation, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and the community's income distribution, policies that improve transit efficiency while maintaining affordability are prioritized. A lower transit fare is preferred to support lower-income residents, while moderate driver fees can help reduce congestion and improve transit times. A balanced sales tax is chosen to ensure adequate funding for transit without overly burdening discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to enhance transit accessibility and efficiency, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and income diversity."
