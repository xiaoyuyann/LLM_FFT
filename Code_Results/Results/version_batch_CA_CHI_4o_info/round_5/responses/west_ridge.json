    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a median income of $68,091 and a per capita income of $32,132. The income distribution shows a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000, which suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income range, a substantial portion of the community may have limited discretionary spending. Policies that increase costs significantly could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a high percentage of residents who drive alone (59.2%) and a smaller percentage using transit (12.5%). This indicates a reliance on cars, but also a need for improved transit options to potentially reduce congestion and provide alternatives.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the income distribution and current transportation usage, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times and services. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times for both transit and driving, while keeping costs manageable for residents."
