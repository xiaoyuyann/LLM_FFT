    "disposable_income": "Dunning has a relatively high percentage of households earning $100,000 or more (41.1%), indicating a moderate to high disposable income level. However, there is also a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000 (29.3%), suggesting income diversity.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of the population in higher income brackets, discretionary consumption is likely robust. However, the presence of lower-income households means that affordability of transportation options remains important.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (72.1%), indicating a strong reliance on personal vehicles. Only 7.3% use transit, suggesting that current transit options may not be as accessible or convenient. Improving transit times could encourage more residents to switch from driving to transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and improve transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable to support transit improvements, but it should not significantly impact discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to balance improved transit service with affordability and reduced driving times."
