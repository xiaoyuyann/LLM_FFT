    "disposable_income": "A significant portion of the community, 31.1%, earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income. The majority of households fall into lower to middle-income brackets, with only 12.7% earning $150,000 or more.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, discretionary spending is likely constrained. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "With 24.4% of residents using transit and 33.9% without a vehicle, affordable and efficient public transportation is crucial. The community also has a high percentage of Asian residents, who may rely on transit for cultural and community connections.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transit suggest prioritizing policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees to improve transit service without significantly increasing costs. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Reducing car travel time is also beneficial, as 41.1% drive alone. Balancing these factors, the selected policies aim to enhance transit efficiency and affordability while considering the community's economic constraints."
