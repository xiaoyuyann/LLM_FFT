    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a median household income of $71,683 and a per capita income of $39,283. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $99,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income. However, 39.5% of households earn less than $50,000, suggesting that affordability is a key concern for a substantial segment of the community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, discretionary spending varies widely. The community must balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. A lower transit fare and driving fee would benefit lower-income households, while a moderate sales tax could support better transit services without overly burdening consumption.",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park has a high car ownership rate, with 89% of households owning at least one vehicle. However, only 9.5% of residents use transit, indicating that improving transit accessibility and reducing travel time could encourage more residents to switch from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income levels and high car ownership, policies that reduce transit fares and driving fees while maintaining a reasonable sales tax are preferred. These policies would enhance transit accessibility and affordability, encouraging a shift from driving to transit. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and fees to minimize the financial burden on residents, while a moderate sales tax supports improved transit services."
