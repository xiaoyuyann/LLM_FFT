    "disposable_income": "The median income in Ashburn is $78,060, with a per capita income of $28,910. A significant portion of the population earns between $50,000 and $149,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees, as these could impact their ability to spend on other necessities and discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (67.6%), with a smaller percentage using transit (11.4%). This suggests that while transit improvements could benefit some, policies should not overly burden drivers, who are the majority.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on driving and moderate income levels, policies that balance transit improvements with minimal financial burden are preferred. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting drivers. A lower sales tax is favored to maintain discretionary spending. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between improving transit times and minimizing costs for both transit users and drivers."
