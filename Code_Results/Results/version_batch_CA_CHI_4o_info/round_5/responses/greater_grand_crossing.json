    "disposable_income": "The median income is $39,908, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "36.5% of households have no vehicle, and 29.5% use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial, as a significant portion of the community relies on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to enhance transit accessibility without imposing significant financial burdens. A lower sales tax is also preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to balance improved transit services with affordability, considering the community's economic constraints and transportation needs."
