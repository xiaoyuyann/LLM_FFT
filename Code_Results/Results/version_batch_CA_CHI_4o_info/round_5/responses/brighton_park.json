    "disposable_income": "The median income in Brighton Park is $52,145, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $22,361, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A majority of residents drive alone (58.8%), but a notable portion (15.1%) uses transit. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (15.4%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income constraints and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit service, as it supports the 15.1% of residents who rely on it. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times while keeping costs manageable for both transit users and drivers."
