    "disposable_income": "Mount Greenwood has a relatively high median income of $113,328 and a per capita income of $47,744. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning over $100,000, the community likely has a higher level of discretionary consumption. However, any increase in taxes or fees could impact this consumption, especially for those in lower income brackets.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (82.2%), with a small percentage using transit (4.2%). This suggests that car travel is the primary mode of transportation, and any policy that increases driving costs could have a significant impact. However, improving transit could provide more options for those without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and preference for driving, policies that minimize driving fees while slightly increasing transit fares and taxes could be beneficial. The community's high income allows for some flexibility in absorbing increased costs, but minimizing impact on discretionary spending is important. Policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs are prioritized to encourage more transit use and reduce congestion."
