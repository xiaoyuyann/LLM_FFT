    "disposable_income": "The community has a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000, with 21.2% earning less than $25,000 and 25.1% earning between $25,000 and $49,999. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, a large portion of the community likely prioritizes essential spending over discretionary consumption. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "With 58.7% driving alone and 13.1% using transit, both modes are important. However, a notable 23.7% of households have no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit. Improving transit times and affordability is crucial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community's income distribution and car ownership patterns suggest a need for affordable transit options. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can improve transit accessibility without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also improve transit times, are prioritized. The selected proposals balance affordability, improved transit times, and minimal impact on disposable income."
