    "disposable_income": "The Near West Side has a relatively high median income of $106,955 and a per capita income of $72,602. A significant portion of the population earns over $150,000, indicating a community with substantial disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income distribution, residents likely have more flexibility in their spending. However, 17.9% of the population earns less than $25,000, suggesting that affordability of transit fares and fees is still a concern for a portion of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a diverse mode of transportation usage: 30.7% drive alone, 18.1% use transit, and 24.1% walk or bike. A significant portion of households (34.3%) do not own a vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit and non-motorized modes for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can potentially absorb higher taxes and fees, but affordability remains a concern for lower-income residents. The community's reliance on transit and non-motorized modes suggests a preference for policies that improve transit service and reduce travel times. Therefore, proposals with moderate to high driver fees and lower transit fares are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is also considered to ensure sustainable funding for transit without overly burdening residents."
