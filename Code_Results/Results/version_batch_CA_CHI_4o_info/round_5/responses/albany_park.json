    "disposable_income": "Albany Park has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of households earning between $25,000 and $149,999. The community has a relatively balanced income distribution, with a notable percentage of higher-income households ($100,000+). This suggests a moderate to high level of disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many households in Albany Park likely have discretionary income to spend on non-essential goods and services. However, a portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating that affordability of transportation options is crucial for these residents.",
    "accessibility": "Albany Park has a high percentage of residents using transit (23.7%) and a significant number of households without a vehicle (19.1%). This indicates a strong reliance on public transportation. The community also has a substantial number of residents who drive alone (45.5%), suggesting that both transit and driving options are important for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the reliance on public transit and the need for affordable options, proposals with lower transit fares are prioritized. However, the community also values efficient transit services, so a balance between fare, tax, and driving fees is necessary. Proposals with moderate sales tax and driving fees are preferred to ensure transit improvements without overly burdening residents financially. The goal is to enhance transit efficiency while maintaining affordability, considering the diverse income levels and transportation needs in Albany Park."
