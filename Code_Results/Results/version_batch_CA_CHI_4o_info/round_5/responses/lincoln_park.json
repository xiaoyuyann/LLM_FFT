    "accessibility": "Lincoln Park has a high percentage of residents using transit (33.4%) and a significant portion working from home (24%). Car ownership is moderate, with 32.3% of households having no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit and non-car modes of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the community's ability to absorb some additional costs, proposals that improve transit times and maintain reasonable costs are prioritized. A lower transit fare is preferred to support lower-income residents, while a moderate sales tax and driving fee are acceptable to enhance transit services. The goal is to balance improved transit efficiency with affordability, considering the community's income diversity and transportation habits."
