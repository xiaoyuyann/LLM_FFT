    "disposable_income": "North Park has a median income of $74,649 and a per capita income of $37,156. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a substantial portion of the population earning above $100,000, there is likely a higher level of discretionary consumption. However, 34.3% of households earn less than $50,000, indicating a need to balance affordability for lower-income residents.",
    "accessibility": "55.6% of residents drive alone, while 17.5% use transit. The mean commute time is 34 minutes, suggesting a need for efficient transit options. Car ownership is high, with 85.4% of households having at least one vehicle, but 14.6% have no vehicle, highlighting the importance of affordable transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and significant use of transit, policies that improve transit times and maintain affordability are crucial. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable given the community's income levels, as it supports better transit services. The focus is on reducing transit times and maintaining affordability for lower-income residents while considering the community's overall disposable income."
