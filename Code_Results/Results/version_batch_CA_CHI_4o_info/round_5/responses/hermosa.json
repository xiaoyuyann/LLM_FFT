    "discretionary_consumption": "With 14.9% of households earning less than $25,000 and 23.1% earning between $25,000 and $49,999, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, impacting their discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "60.9% of residents drive alone, while 17.7% use transit. Car ownership is high, with 87.5% of households owning at least one vehicle. This suggests a reliance on both driving and transit, with a need for efficient and affordable options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax can support transit improvements without overly burdening residents. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs while maintaining accessibility and affordability."
