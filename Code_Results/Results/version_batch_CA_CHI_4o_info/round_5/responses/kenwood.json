    "disposable_income": "Kenwood has a median income of $58,052 and a per capita income of $55,311. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, which suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.4% of households earning less than $25,000, any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact discretionary spending. The community needs to balance affordable transit fares and taxes with the need for improved services.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has a high percentage of residents using transit (23.1%) and a significant portion without vehicles (33.1%). This indicates a reliance on public transportation, making transit accessibility and affordability crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transit and the need for affordability, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. The goal is to improve transit times without significantly increasing costs for low-income residents. Proposals with higher driver fees are considered to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The selected proposals aim to balance improved transit service with affordability, considering the community's income distribution and transportation needs."
