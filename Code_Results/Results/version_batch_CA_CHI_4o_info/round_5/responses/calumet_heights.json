    "disposable_income": "The median income in Calumet Heights is $68,436, with a per capita income of $39,867. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, as these could impact their ability to spend on other necessities and discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "52.3% of residents drive alone, while 19.5% use transit. A significant portion of the community relies on cars, but a notable percentage also depends on public transit. Accessibility improvements in transit could benefit a large segment of the population.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost and service improvements. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax would preserve disposable income for other needs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The selected proposals aim to improve transit service while maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers."
