    "disposable_income": "The median income in Austin is $40,086, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $23,403, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "30.6% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% of residents use transit to commute. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized. A lower sales tax is also preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The goal is to enhance transit accessibility while keeping costs manageable for residents."
