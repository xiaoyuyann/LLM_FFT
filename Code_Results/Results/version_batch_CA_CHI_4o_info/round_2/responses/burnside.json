    "disposable_income": "The median income in Burnside is $46,711, with a significant portion of households earning between $25,000 and $49,999. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with a need to balance costs carefully.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, a large portion of the community may have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "With 27.6% of residents using transit and 40.3% driving alone, both modes of transportation are important. However, 38.7% of households do not own a vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit for accessibility to resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "The decision prioritizes policies that balance lower costs for transit users and drivers while improving transit times. Given the high percentage of residents without vehicles, affordable and efficient transit is crucial. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting both transit users and drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as it supports the large transit-dependent population."
