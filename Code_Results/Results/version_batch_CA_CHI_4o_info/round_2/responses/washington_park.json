    "disposable_income": "Washington Park has a median income of $26,014 and a per capita income of $19,948. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With nearly half of the households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "42.8% of households do not own a vehicle, and 32.3% of the population relies on public transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies that minimize fare increases and support transit improvements are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid further burdening the community's limited discretionary spending. Driver fees are considered as a means to improve transit services and reduce congestion, benefiting transit users. The selected policies aim to balance affordability, transit service improvement, and minimal impact on discretionary spending."
