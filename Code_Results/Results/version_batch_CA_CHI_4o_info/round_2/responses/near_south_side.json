    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side has a high median household income of $124,558 and a per capita income of $94,087, indicating a relatively affluent community with significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 43.7% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has a high capacity for discretionary spending. However, 12.9% of households earn less than $25,000, suggesting a need to consider affordability for lower-income residents.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a balanced mode of transportation usage with 41.9% driving alone and 22.7% using transit. A significant portion of the population works from home (22.7%), reducing daily transportation needs. Car ownership is moderate, with 22.4% of households having no vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can afford moderate increases in taxes and fees if they result in improved transit services. However, affordability for lower-income residents must be considered. Proposals that reduce travel time for both drivers and transit users are prioritized, as they enhance accessibility and convenience. A balance between tax rates, transit fares, and driving fees is sought to ensure equitable access to improved services without disproportionately impacting lower-income residents."
