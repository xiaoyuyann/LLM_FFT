    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Deering is $34,814, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "23.7% of residents use transit, and 57.2% drive alone. Improving transit times and reducing costs could benefit a large portion of the community, especially those without vehicles (24%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that reduce costs while improving transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to balance affordability and service improvement. Driver fees are considered to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, but they should not be too high to avoid burdening drivers. The selected policies aim to improve transit accessibility and affordability, considering the community's income constraints and transportation needs."
