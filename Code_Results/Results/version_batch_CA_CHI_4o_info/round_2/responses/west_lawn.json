    "discretionary_consumption": "With 36.9% of households earning less than $50,000, there is a need to balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees.",
    "accessibility": "63.4% of residents drive alone, while 9.8% use transit. Car ownership is high, with 56.3% of households owning two or more vehicles. This suggests a reliance on driving, but also a need for efficient transit options for those who use it.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income levels and high car ownership, policies that minimize costs while improving transit efficiency are prioritized. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A balanced sales tax is preferred to support transit improvements without overly burdening residents. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, enhancing overall accessibility."
