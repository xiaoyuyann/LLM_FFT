    "disposable_income": "The median income in Avalon Park is $54,139, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests that disposable income is limited for many residents, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 24% of households earning less than $25,000, a large portion of the community may prioritize essential spending over discretionary consumption. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are likely to be preferred.",
    "accessibility": "With 24.1% of residents using transit and 58.5% driving alone, both transit and driving are important. However, a significant portion of the community relies on transit, so improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both transit and driving, the ideal policies should balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a lower sales tax, are prioritized."
