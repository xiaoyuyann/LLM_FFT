    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, a large portion of the community may have limited discretionary spending. Therefore, policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower transit fares and driving fees, would be more favorable.",
    "accessibility": "With 59.6% of residents driving alone and 12.9% using transit, accessibility improvements in both driving and transit are important. Reducing travel times and costs for both modes can enhance accessibility to resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community's preference leans towards minimizing costs while improving transit services. Lower fares and driving fees are prioritized to accommodate the moderate income levels. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial, as higher taxes could strain household budgets. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs, encouraging a shift from driving to transit, which could alleviate congestion and improve overall accessibility."
