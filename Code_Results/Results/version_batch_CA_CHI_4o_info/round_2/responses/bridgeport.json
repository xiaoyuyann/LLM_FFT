    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a median income of $72,159 and a per capita income of $38,718. The income distribution shows a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000, which suggests a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income range, discretionary consumption varies. A significant portion of the population may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees, as these could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Bridgeport has a relatively high car ownership rate, with 82.2% of households owning at least one vehicle. However, 16% of the population uses transit, indicating a need for efficient and affordable public transportation options. The community's accessibility to resources and services is balanced between driving and transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and the need for affordable transit options, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred. A lower sales tax is also favorable to maintain discretionary consumption. The goal is to improve transit efficiency without significantly increasing costs for residents. Proposals that reduce travel time for both transit and driving while keeping costs manageable are prioritized."
