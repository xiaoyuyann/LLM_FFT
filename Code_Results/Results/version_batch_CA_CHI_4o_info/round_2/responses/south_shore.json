    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Shore is $39,649, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 33% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "A high percentage of residents (32.8%) use transit, and 37.8% of households do not own a vehicle. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The selected policies balance affordability with improved transit service, considering the community's economic constraints and transportation needs."
