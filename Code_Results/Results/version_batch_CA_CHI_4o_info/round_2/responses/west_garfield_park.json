    "disposable_income": "West Garfield Park has a relatively low median income of $36,360 and a per capita income of $18,503. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "38.7% of households do not have a vehicle, and 27.9% of residents use transit. This indicates a reliance on public transportation, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial for accessibility to jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low income levels and high reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized to minimize financial burden while improving transit efficiency. Proposals with higher driver fees are favored to encourage a shift from driving to transit, potentially reducing congestion and improving transit times. The selected proposals balance affordability, improved transit service, and reduced travel times."
