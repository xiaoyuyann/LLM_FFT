    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a median income of $31,762 and a per capita income of $20,343. A significant portion of the population (43.7%) earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of the population earning below $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "40% of households do not own a vehicle, and 25% of the population relies on transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community. The mean commute time is 35.1 minutes, indicating a need for efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing transit time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Proposals with a balance of lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting both transit users and drivers."
