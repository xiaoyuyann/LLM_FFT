    "disposable_income": "The median household income in Humboldt Park is $51,105, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on transit (20.1%) and carpooling (11.3%), with 25% of households having no vehicle. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit services and reduce congestion, are preferred. The balance between cost and improved service is key, considering the community's economic constraints and transportation needs."
