    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Park has a high median household income of $134,277 and a per capita income of $109,538, indicating a relatively high level of disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 44.8% of households earning $150,000 and over, residents likely have significant discretionary spending power. However, a portion of the population (11.4%) earns less than $25,000, which should be considered when evaluating fare and fee impacts.",
    "accessibility": "Lincoln Park has a high percentage of residents using transit (33.4%) and a significant portion without vehicles (32.3%). This suggests a strong reliance on public transportation, making transit accessibility and affordability crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the community's overall high income, policies that improve transit times and maintain reasonable costs are prioritized. A lower fare is preferred to support lower-income residents, while a moderate sales tax and driver fee can be justified to enhance transit services. The goal is to balance improved transit efficiency with affordability, considering the community's income distribution and travel habits."
