    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a median household income of $71,683 and a per capita income of $39,283. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $99,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees. The community's consumption patterns could be affected by higher taxes and fees, impacting their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (64.9%), with a smaller percentage using transit (9.5%). Car ownership is high, with 88.7% of households having at least one vehicle. This suggests that while transit improvements are beneficial, policies should not overly burden drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on driving and moderate income levels, policies that balance transit improvements with reasonable costs for drivers and transit users are preferred. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden lower-income households. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and improve transit services while considering the community's financial constraints."
