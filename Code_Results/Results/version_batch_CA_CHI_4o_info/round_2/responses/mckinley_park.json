    "disposable_income": "The median income in McKinley Park is $70,411, with a per capita income of $32,106. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $149,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to changes in transportation costs, especially those earning less than $50,000. The community's discretionary spending could be impacted by higher transit fares or driver fees.",
    "accessibility": "51.5% of residents drive alone, while 21.7% use transit. The community has a moderate reliance on transit, and improvements in transit services could benefit a significant portion of the population. However, 12.2% of households have no vehicle, indicating a need for affordable transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income levels and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower transit fares and moderate driver fees to enhance accessibility while considering the community's income constraints."
