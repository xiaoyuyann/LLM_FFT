    "disposable_income": "Beverly has a relatively high median income of $131,170 and a per capita income of $64,719. A significant portion of the population earns $150,000 and over, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending capacity. However, any increase in taxes or fees could still impact their consumption patterns, especially for those in lower income brackets.",
    "accessibility": "62% of residents drive alone, while 17% use transit. Car ownership is high, with 43.6% owning two vehicles and 15.4% owning three or more. This suggests a strong reliance on personal vehicles, but a notable portion also depends on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, Beverly residents can absorb some increases in taxes and fees, but the community's reliance on driving suggests that policies reducing driving time and improving transit efficiency are beneficial. A balance between maintaining low costs and improving transit services is crucial. Proposals with moderate taxes and fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. The community's high car ownership and preference for driving alone mean that reducing driving time is a key factor. Therefore, proposals that offer a good balance of reduced travel times for both driving and transit, without excessively increasing costs, are preferred."
