    "disposable_income": "The median income in Hermosa is $66,073, with a per capita income of $27,053. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $74,999, indicating moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 14.9% of households earning less than $25,000 and 23.1% earning between $25,000 and $49,999, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, affecting their discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "60.9% of residents drive alone, while 17.7% use transit. Car ownership is high, with only 12.5% of households without a vehicle. This suggests a reliance on both driving and transit, with a need for efficient and affordable options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax can support transit improvements without overly burdening residents. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and a balanced sales tax are prioritized to enhance transit accessibility while considering the community's financial constraints."
