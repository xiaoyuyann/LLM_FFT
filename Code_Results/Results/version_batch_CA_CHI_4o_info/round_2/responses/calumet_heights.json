    "disposable_income": "The median income in Calumet Heights is $68,436, with a per capita income of $39,867. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, as these could impact their ability to spend on other necessities and discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "52.3% of residents drive alone, while 19.5% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 80.6% of households owning at least one vehicle. This suggests that both driving and transit are important modes of transportation for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income levels and reliance on both driving and transit, the ideal policy would balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, while considering the community's income sensitivity."
