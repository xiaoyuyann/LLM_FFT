    "disposable_income": "West Town has a high median income of $128,717 and a per capita income of $82,088, indicating a relatively affluent community with significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 43.9% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has a high capacity for discretionary spending. However, a significant portion of the population (9.8%) earns less than $25,000, which should be considered when evaluating the impact of increased costs.",
    "accessibility": "West Town has a diverse mode of transportation usage with 23.2% using transit and 35.1% driving alone. The community also has a high percentage of residents working from home (26.3%), which may reduce the overall impact of transportation costs. Car ownership is moderate, with 20.2% of households having no vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, the community can absorb moderate increases in transit fares and driver fees. However, the presence of lower-income residents necessitates consideration of affordable transit options. A balance between improving transit services and maintaining reasonable costs is crucial. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while a moderate sales tax supports transit improvements without significantly impacting discretionary spending."
