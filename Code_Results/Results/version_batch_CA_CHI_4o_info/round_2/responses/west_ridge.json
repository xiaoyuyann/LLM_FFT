    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a median income of $68,091 and a per capita income of $32,132. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "59.2% of residents drive alone, while 12.5% use transit. This suggests a need for policies that balance improvements in transit with maintaining reasonable driving conditions.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times for both modes while keeping costs manageable for the community."
