    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has a median income of $41,144 and a per capita income of $19,721. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A majority of residents drive alone (67.9%), but a notable portion (12.9%) relies on transit. The mean commute time is 33.8 minutes, suggesting a need for efficient and affordable transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that minimize costs while improving transit efficiency are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance affordability and service improvement. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to reduce travel time and costs for both drivers and transit users, enhancing overall accessibility without imposing significant financial burdens."
