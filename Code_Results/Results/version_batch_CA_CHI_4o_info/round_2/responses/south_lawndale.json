    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a median household income of $42,010 and a per capita income of $18,001, indicating limited disposable income. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, suggesting that affordability is a key concern.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "56.5% of residents drive alone, while 15.3% use transit. The community has a moderate reliance on transit, but a significant portion also depends on driving. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income, proposals with lower fares and taxes are prioritized to minimize financial burden. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, but improved transit times, are preferred. The community's reliance on both driving and transit suggests that moderate driver fees could be acceptable if they lead to significant improvements in transit service and reduced congestion."
