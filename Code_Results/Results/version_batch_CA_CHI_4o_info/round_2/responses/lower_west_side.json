    "disposable_income": "The median income is $69,810, with a per capita income of $36,151. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 18.4% of households earning less than $25,000 and 19.3% earning between $25,000 and $49,999, a large segment of the community may have limited discretionary spending. Thus, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferable to maintain affordability.",
    "accessibility": "24.5% of residents use transit, and 23.8% have no vehicle, highlighting the importance of affordable and efficient public transit. The community also has a significant number of residents who drive alone (43.8%), so policies that reduce driving time and costs are also beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both transit and driving, the ideal policies should balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use while reducing congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden lower-income households. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while maintaining a reasonable tax rate to support transit improvements."
