    "disposable_income": "Logan Square has a relatively high median income of $97,759 and a per capita income of $62,532. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, residents likely have a higher capacity for discretionary spending. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, which means affordability of transit and driving fees is still a concern for some.",
    "accessibility": "Logan Square has a diverse mode of transportation usage with 26.5% using transit and 36.6% driving alone. The community has a significant number of households without a vehicle (21.2%), indicating a reliance on public transit. Accessibility improvements in transit could benefit a large portion of the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and the significant number of households without vehicles, policies that improve transit times and affordability are prioritized. A balance between transit fare, sales tax, and driving fees is crucial to ensure affordability while enhancing service quality. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to maintain affordability for lower-income residents, while moderate driving fees can help reduce congestion and improve transit service."
