    "disposable_income": "Norwood Park has a relatively high median income of $107,122 and a per capita income of $49,303. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high median income, residents likely have more discretionary spending capacity. However, a significant portion of the population (25.1%) earns less than $50,000, so affordability of transit and driving fees is still a concern for a portion of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (71.1%) drive alone, indicating a strong reliance on personal vehicles. Only 7.3% use transit, suggesting that improvements in transit could benefit a small but significant portion of the community. Car ownership is high, with 92.3% of households owning at least one vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and costs are prioritized. However, improving transit is also important to provide alternatives and reduce congestion. A balance between low transit fares and moderate driver fees is ideal to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable given the community's income levels, as it supports better transit services. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times for both modes while keeping costs manageable for all income levels."
