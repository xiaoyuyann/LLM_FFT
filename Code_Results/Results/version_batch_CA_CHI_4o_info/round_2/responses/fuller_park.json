    "disposable_income": "The majority of households in Fuller Park have an income of less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income. This suggests that any increase in costs, whether through transit fares, sales taxes, or driving fees, could significantly impact residents' financial situations.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely minimal. Residents may prioritize essential goods and services, making them sensitive to any policy that increases their cost of living.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on transit (18.7%) and carpooling (22.6%), with a high percentage of households without a vehicle (58%). This indicates a reliance on affordable and efficient public transportation options. Improving transit times and maintaining low fares would be beneficial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's low income and reliance on public transit, policies that minimize fare increases and improve transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid further financial strain on residents. Driver fees are considered as a means to improve transit services and reduce congestion, but they should not be too high to avoid burdening those who drive. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency."
