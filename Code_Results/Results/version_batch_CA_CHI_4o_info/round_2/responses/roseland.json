    "discretionary_consumption": "With 50.1% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "25.9% of households have no vehicle, and 20.1% of residents use transit to commute. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to enhance affordability and transit service quality. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced transit fares and moderate driver fees, which could improve transit service and reduce congestion, benefiting both transit users and drivers."
