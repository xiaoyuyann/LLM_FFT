    "disposable_income": "North Center has a high median income of $148,585 and a per capita income of $88,926, indicating a relatively high level of disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49.5% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has significant discretionary spending power. However, a portion of the population (8.3%) earns less than $25,000, which should be considered when evaluating fare and fee impacts.",
    "accessibility": "38.6% of residents drive alone, and 20% use transit, indicating a balanced reliance on both modes. The community has a high rate of car ownership, with 87.4% of households owning at least one vehicle, suggesting that driving is a common mode of transport.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, the community can absorb moderate increases in taxes and fees. However, to support the 20% of residents who rely on transit, maintaining or improving transit affordability and service quality is important. Reducing travel times for both driving and transit is beneficial, but the community's high car ownership suggests that policies should not overly penalize drivers. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate taxes and fees that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs are preferred."
