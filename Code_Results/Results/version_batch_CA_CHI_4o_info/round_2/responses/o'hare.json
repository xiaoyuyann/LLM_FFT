    "disposable_income": "O'Hare is a mixed-income area with a range of income levels, but generally has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to the airport and associated employment opportunities.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in O'Hare likely have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on housing, transportation, and leisure activities due to the area's connectivity and amenities.",
    "accessibility": "O'Hare has good accessibility to resources and services, with strong transit links due to the airport and major highways, making both driving and public transit viable options for residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares or driving fees if it results in better services. The community benefits from reduced congestion and improved transit times, which are crucial for those working at or traveling to the airport. A balanced approach with moderate taxes and fees that improve transit times without significantly impacting discretionary spending is preferred. Therefore, proposals with moderate taxes and fees that offer significant improvements in travel times are prioritized."
