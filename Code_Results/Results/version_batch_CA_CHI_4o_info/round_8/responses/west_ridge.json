    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a median income of $68,091 and a per capita income of $32,132. The income distribution shows a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000, which suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a significant portion of the community may have limited discretionary spending. Policies that increase costs significantly could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "59.2% of residents drive alone, while 12.5% use transit. This indicates a reliance on both driving and public transit, with a notable portion of the population potentially benefiting from improved transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance affordability with improved transit services are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this could benefit the 12.5% of transit users and potentially encourage more to switch from driving, reducing congestion. The top-ranked policies reflect a balance between cost and improved service, aiming to enhance accessibility while considering the financial constraints of the community."
