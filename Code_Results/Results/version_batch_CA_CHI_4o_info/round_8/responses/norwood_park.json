    "disposable_income": "Norwood Park has a relatively high median income of $107,122 and a per capita income of $49,303. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high median income, residents likely have more discretionary spending capacity. However, a higher sales tax could impact their consumption of non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (71.1%), with only 7.3% using transit. This suggests a strong reliance on personal vehicles, but also a potential for increased transit use if services improve.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and improve transit efficiency are prioritized. A balance between maintaining low costs and improving transit services is crucial. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable given the community's income levels, as it supports better transit services. The top-ranked policies reflect a preference for reduced travel times and costs, with a focus on improving transit to potentially shift some drivers to public transportation."
