    "disposable_income": "The community has a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000, with 21.2% earning less than $25,000 and 25.1% earning between $25,000 and $49,999. This suggests a moderate to low disposable income level, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, a large portion of the community likely prioritizes essential spending over discretionary consumption. Therefore, policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "With 58.7% of residents driving alone and 13.1% using transit, both modes are important. However, the high car ownership and reliance on driving suggest that policies should not overly penalize drivers while still improving transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community's moderate to low income levels and reliance on both driving and transit necessitate a balanced approach. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the financial burden on households. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, while also considering the community's income constraints."
