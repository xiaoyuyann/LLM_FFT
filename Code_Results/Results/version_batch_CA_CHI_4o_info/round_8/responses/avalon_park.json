    "disposable_income": "The median income in Avalon Park is $54,139, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests that disposable income is limited for many residents, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 24% of households earning less than $25,000 and 21.5% earning between $25,000 and $49,999, a large portion of the community has limited discretionary spending. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "24.1% of residents use transit, and 58.5% drive alone. With 23.6% of households having no vehicle, improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial. However, driving is still the predominant mode, so policies that balance both transit and driving costs are important.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both transit and driving, the ideal policies should reduce costs for transit users while not overly burdening drivers. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting those who drive. A moderate sales tax can support transit improvements without heavily impacting discretionary spending. Therefore, policies with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and moderate sales taxes are prioritized."
