    "disposable_income": "The median income in Hegewisch is $58,647, with a per capita income of $31,457. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.6% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and taxes that reduce disposable income.",
    "accessibility": "65.2% of residents drive alone, while only 10.8% use transit. This suggests a reliance on cars, but also a need for improved transit options to potentially reduce car dependency and improve accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on driving, policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with minimal tax increases are preferred. This approach aims to enhance transit accessibility without significantly impacting disposable income. Lower fares encourage transit use, while moderate driver fees can reduce congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax minimizes the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies reflect these priorities, aiming to improve transit times and accessibility while considering the community's financial constraints."
