    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a median household income of $42,010 and a per capita income of $18,001, indicating limited disposable income. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, which suggests that affordability is a key concern for the community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a relatively high percentage of residents who drive alone (56.5%) and a notable portion who use transit (15.3%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordability could benefit a significant portion of the population, especially those without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to maintain affordability. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Proposals that improve transit times are favored to enhance accessibility for transit users. The ranking reflects a balance between affordability, improved transit service, and minimal impact on discretionary income."
