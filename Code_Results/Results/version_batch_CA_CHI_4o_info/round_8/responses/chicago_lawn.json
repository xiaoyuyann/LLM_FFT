    "disposable_income": "The median income in Chicago Lawn is $43,293, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $20,907, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A large portion of the community relies on driving (57.8%) and carpooling (20.6%), with 14.9% using transit. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (24.3%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income constraints and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as it supports the 14.9% who rely on transit and could encourage more to switch from driving, reducing congestion and emissions."
