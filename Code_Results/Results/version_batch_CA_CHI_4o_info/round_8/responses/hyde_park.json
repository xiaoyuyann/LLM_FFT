    "disposable_income": "Hyde Park has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000 annually. However, there is also a substantial percentage earning over $100,000, indicating a mixed-income community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, a significant portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, particularly those in the lower income brackets. However, the presence of higher-income households suggests some capacity for discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Hyde Park has a high percentage of residents using transit and walking/biking, with a significant portion of households not owning a vehicle. This indicates a reliance on public transportation and non-motorized modes for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the high reliance on public transit and non-motorized modes, policies that improve transit times and maintain affordability are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The community's mixed-income nature requires balancing affordability with service improvements."
