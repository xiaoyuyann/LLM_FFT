    "disposable_income": "Irving Park has a relatively high median income of $86,849 and a per capita income of $48,320. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a substantial portion of the population earning over $100,000, the community likely has a higher level of discretionary spending. However, 28.6% of households earn less than $50,000, so affordability remains a concern for a significant minority.",
    "accessibility": "49.6% of residents drive alone, and 18.5% use transit, indicating a reliance on both modes of transportation. The community has a moderate level of car ownership, with 13.9% of households having no vehicle, suggesting the importance of accessible and affordable transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and transportation preferences, the focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use while maintaining affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable to support transit improvements, given the community's disposable income. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving, with a focus on maintaining or improving accessibility for lower-income residents."
