    "disposable_income": "The median income in Oakland is $27,693, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 47.2% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens, such as lower fares and taxes, are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "41.7% of households do not own a vehicle, and 19.9% use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial, as a significant portion of the community relies on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high percentage of low-income households and reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times without excessive cost increases, are ranked higher."
