    "disposable_income": "The median income in Pullman is $54,755, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests that disposable income is limited for many residents, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $32,327, residents may have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "64% of residents drive alone, while 17.6% use transit. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares could benefit a significant portion of the community, especially those without vehicles (16.1%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the income distribution and car ownership statistics, policies that reduce transit fares and driving times while maintaining a reasonable sales tax are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve accessibility without overly burdening residents financially. The selected policies aim to balance cost, accessibility, and service improvement."
