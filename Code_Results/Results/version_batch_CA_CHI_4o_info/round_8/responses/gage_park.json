    "disposable_income": "The median income in Gage Park is $50,112, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $19,524, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A large portion of the community relies on driving (59.6%) and transit (17.9%). Policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs would benefit the community, especially given the 20.5% of households without a vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income constraints and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Moderate driver fees are acceptable if they significantly reduce travel times, benefiting both drivers and transit users. The top-ranked policies reflect a balance between affordability and improved accessibility, considering the community's economic profile and transportation needs."
