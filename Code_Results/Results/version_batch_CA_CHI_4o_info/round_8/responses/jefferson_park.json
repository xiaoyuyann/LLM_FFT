    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park has a relatively high median household income of $90,740 and a per capita income of $42,024. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high median income, residents likely have a reasonable amount of discretionary income. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, so affordability of transit and driving fees is still a concern for some households.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (61.7%), with only 13.4% using transit. Car ownership is high, with 89.2% of households owning at least one vehicle. This suggests that while transit improvements are beneficial, policies should not overly burden drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and preference for driving, policies that reduce driving time and cost are prioritized. However, improving transit is also important to provide alternatives and reduce congestion. A balance between low transit fares and moderate driver fees is ideal. Lower sales tax rates are preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times for both modes while keeping costs manageable, especially for lower-income residents."
