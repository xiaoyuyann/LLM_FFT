    "disposable_income": "The median income in Washington Park is $26,014, with a significant portion of the population (49.3%) earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies crucial.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $19,948, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "42.8% of households do not own a vehicle, and 32.3% of residents use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is essential, but it must be balanced with the community's financial constraints.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The goal is to enhance transit accessibility while keeping costs manageable for residents. Policies that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are also favored to improve overall accessibility and efficiency."
