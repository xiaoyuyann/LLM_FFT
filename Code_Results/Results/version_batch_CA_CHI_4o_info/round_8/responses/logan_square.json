    "disposable_income": "Logan Square has a relatively high median income of $97,759 and a per capita income of $62,532. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning over $100,000, discretionary consumption is likely robust. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, which means affordability of transit and driving fees is still a concern for a segment of the community.",
    "accessibility": "Logan Square has a diverse mode of transportation usage with 26.5% using transit and 36.6% driving alone. The community also has a significant portion of residents without vehicles (21.2%), indicating a reliance on public transit. Accessibility improvements in transit could benefit a large portion of the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on both transit and driving, policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driving fees are preferred. A lower sales tax is also favorable to maintain discretionary spending. The community would benefit from reduced travel times, especially for transit, to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals that offer reduced transit times and moderate costs are prioritized. The top choices reflect a balance between affordability and improved service, considering the community's income distribution and transportation preferences."
