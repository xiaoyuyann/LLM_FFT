    "disposable_income": "Edgewater has a median income of $67,796 and a per capita income of $51,717. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, which suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as higher fares or driver fees, which could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Edgewater has a high percentage of residents using transit (33.2%) and a significant portion without vehicles (38.8%). This indicates a strong reliance on public transportation, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the income distribution, the community would benefit from policies that maintain or improve transit affordability and efficiency without significantly increasing the cost of living. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more transit use, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized, balancing cost and service improvements."
