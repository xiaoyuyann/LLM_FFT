    "disposable_income": "Beverly has a relatively high median income of $131,170 and a per capita income of $64,719. A significant portion of households earn $150,000 and over, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending capacity. However, they may still be sensitive to changes in costs related to transportation, especially if it affects their overall lifestyle and consumption patterns.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (62%), with a smaller portion using transit (17%). Car ownership is high, with 43.6% owning two vehicles and 15.4% owning three or more. This suggests a strong reliance on personal vehicles, but also a significant transit-using population that could benefit from improved services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, Beverly residents can absorb some increases in costs, but they value efficiency and time savings. Proposals that reduce travel time, especially for driving, are attractive. However, improving transit times and maintaining reasonable fares are also important for the 17% who rely on transit. A balanced approach that slightly increases taxes and fees to improve transit services while reducing travel times for both modes is ideal. Proposals with moderate tax increases and driver fees, coupled with reduced travel times, are prioritized. The community's high car ownership and preference for driving suggest that reducing car travel time is a key factor, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs."
