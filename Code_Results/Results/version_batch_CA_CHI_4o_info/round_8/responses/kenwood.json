    "disposable_income": "Kenwood has a median income of $58,052 and a per capita income of $55,311. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.4% of households earning less than $25,000, affordability is crucial. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees, as these could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "33.1% of households do not own a vehicle, and 23.1% use transit, highlighting the importance of maintaining affordable and efficient public transportation. The community's reliance on transit suggests that policies improving transit times and affordability would be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high percentage of residents without vehicles and those using transit, policies that improve transit times and maintain or reduce costs are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The community's income distribution suggests that lower fares and fees are more favorable. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which improve transit times, are prioritized. The tradeoff between transit time improvements and cost increases is carefully balanced to ensure affordability and accessibility."
