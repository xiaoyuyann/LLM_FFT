    "disposable_income": "The median income in Washington Heights is $66,797, with a per capita income of $29,673. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a substantial portion of the population earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "58.2% of residents drive alone, while 22.3% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 83.2% of households owning at least one vehicle. However, 16.8% of households have no vehicle, relying on transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit service, as it supports those without vehicles. The top-ranked policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while considering the community's limited disposable income."
