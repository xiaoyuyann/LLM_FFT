    "disposable_income": "The median income in Woodlawn is $29,969, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the population relies on transit (24.3%) and a notable percentage has no vehicle (38.1%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times without imposing high costs, are preferred."
