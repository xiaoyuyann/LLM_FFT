    "disposable_income": "Englewood has a low median income of $27,792 and a per capita income of $17,897. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "44.6% of households do not own a vehicle, and 25.2% of residents rely on transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community. The current transit time is 58.8 minutes, which is relatively high.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low income levels, minimizing costs is essential. A lower transit fare and driver fee are prioritized to reduce financial burdens. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as many residents rely on public transportation. The focus is on proposals that offer the best balance between cost and improved transit service, considering the high reliance on public transit and limited vehicle ownership."
