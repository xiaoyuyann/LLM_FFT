    "discretionary_consumption": "With 36.9% of households earning less than $50,000, there is a need to balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees.",
    "accessibility": "63.4% of residents drive alone, while 9.8% use transit. Car ownership is high, with 56.3% owning two or more vehicles. This suggests a reliance on driving, but also a need for efficient transit options for those who use it.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and high car ownership, policies that reduce travel time and cost for both drivers and transit users are prioritized. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A balanced sales tax is preferred to support transit improvements without significantly impacting discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to improve transit efficiency and reduce driving time, benefiting both modes of transportation."
