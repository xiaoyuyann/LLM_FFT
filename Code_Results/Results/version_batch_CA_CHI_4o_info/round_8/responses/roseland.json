    "disposable_income": "The median income in Roseland is $49,808, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests that disposable income is limited, and any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the community's financial well-being.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $24,754, discretionary spending is likely constrained. A large portion of the community's income is likely allocated to essential expenses, leaving limited room for additional costs such as higher transit fares or driver fees.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on driving (53.9% drive alone) and transit (20.1% use transit) for commuting. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (25.9% of households).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the priority is to minimize costs while improving transit accessibility. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary consumption. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, particularly for transit users, while keeping the sales tax and driver fees at manageable levels."
