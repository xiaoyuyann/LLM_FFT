    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Deering is $34,814, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 38.6% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens, such as lower fares and taxes, are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "23.7% of residents use transit, and 24% have no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transportation. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The selected policies balance affordability with improved transit service, considering the community's economic constraints and transportation needs."
