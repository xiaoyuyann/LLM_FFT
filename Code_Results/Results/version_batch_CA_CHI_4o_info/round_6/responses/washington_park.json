    "disposable_income": "The median income in Washington Park is $26,014, with a significant portion of the population (49.3%) earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies crucial.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $19,948, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "42.8% of households do not own a vehicle, and 32.3% of residents use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is essential, as a large portion of the community relies on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's low income and high reliance on public transit, policies that minimize costs while improving transit efficiency are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The selected policies balance affordability, improved transit service, and reduced travel times."
