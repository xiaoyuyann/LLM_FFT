    "disposable_income": "The Near West Side has a relatively high median income of $106,955 and a per capita income of $72,602. A significant portion of the population earns over $150,000, indicating a community with substantial disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income distribution, residents likely have more flexibility in their spending. However, 17.9% of the population earns less than $25,000, so affordability remains a concern for a portion of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The community has diverse transportation options with 18.1% using transit and 24.1% walking or biking. Car ownership is moderate, with 34.3% of households having no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit and non-motorized transport.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can afford moderate increases in taxes and fees if it results in better transit services. However, affordability for lower-income residents must be considered. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial, as is maintaining or improving transit accessibility. Proposals that significantly reduce travel time for both transit and driving are prioritized to enhance overall accessibility."
