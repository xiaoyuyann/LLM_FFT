    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a median income of $31,762 and a per capita income of $20,343. A significant portion of the population (43.7%) earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of the population earning below $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "40% of households do not own a vehicle, and 25% of the population relies on transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community. The mean commute time is 35.1 minutes, suggesting a need for efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Reducing transit times is also important to improve accessibility. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering lower fares and moderate driver fees, which could encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
