    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Lawndale is $42,010, with a per capita income of $18,001. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "56.5% of residents drive alone, while 15.3% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, but a notable portion of the community relies on public transit, indicating the importance of affordable and efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance affordability and service improvement. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel time and costs for both drivers and transit users, enhancing overall accessibility without imposing significant financial burdens."
