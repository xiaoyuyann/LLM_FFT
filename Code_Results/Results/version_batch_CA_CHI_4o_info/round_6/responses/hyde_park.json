    "disposable_income": "Hyde Park has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000 annually. However, there is also a substantial percentage earning over $100,000, indicating a mixed-income community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a notable percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely limited for a significant portion of the community. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "Hyde Park has a high percentage of residents using transit (22.5%) and walking/biking (29.4%), with a significant portion of households not owning a vehicle (43.4%). This suggests a strong reliance on public transit and non-motorized modes of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the mixed-income nature of the community, policies that maintain or improve transit accessibility without significantly increasing costs are prioritized. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents depend on public transportation. The top-ranked proposals balance these considerations by offering reduced travel times and costs for transit users while maintaining reasonable tax and fee levels."
