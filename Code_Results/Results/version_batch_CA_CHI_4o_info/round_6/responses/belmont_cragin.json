    "disposable_income": "Belmont Cragin has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of households earning below $50,000. This suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of households in lower income brackets, discretionary spending is likely limited. Therefore, policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "A majority of residents drive alone, but a notable portion also uses transit. Improving transit times and affordability could benefit those who rely on public transportation, while also considering the impact on drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, the ideal policy would balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a lower sales tax, are prioritized."
