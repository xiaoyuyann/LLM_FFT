    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a median household income of $71,683 and a per capita income of $39,283. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $99,999, indicating moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees. The community's spending on goods and services could be impacted by higher taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park has a high percentage of residents who drive alone (64.9%), with only 9.5% using transit. Car ownership is prevalent, with 49% having one vehicle and 28.7% having two vehicles. Accessibility to resources is primarily car-dependent, but improving transit could benefit the 11.3% without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on driving and moderate income levels, policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with reasonable travel times are preferred. Lower sales taxes are favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The goal is to improve transit accessibility without significantly increasing costs for drivers or reducing disposable income through high taxes."
