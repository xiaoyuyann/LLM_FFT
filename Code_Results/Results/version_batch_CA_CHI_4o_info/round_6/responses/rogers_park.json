    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a median income of $57,591 and a per capita income of $36,162. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 44.8% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact these households.",
    "accessibility": "Rogers Park has a high reliance on public transit (28.1%) and a significant portion of households without a vehicle (37.2%). Accessibility to affordable and efficient transit is crucial for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, policies that minimize fare increases while improving transit efficiency are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this benefits a large portion of the community. Driver fees are less impactful due to lower car ownership, but they can help reduce congestion and improve transit times. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit service, considering the community's economic constraints and transportation needs."
