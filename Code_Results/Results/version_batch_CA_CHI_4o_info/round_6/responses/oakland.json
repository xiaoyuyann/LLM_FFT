    "disposable_income": "The median income in Oakland is $27,693, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies crucial.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 47.2% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "41.7% of households do not own a vehicle, and 19.9% use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is important, but driving costs should also be considered for those who drive.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low income levels, policies with lower fares and taxes are prioritized to reduce financial strain. However, improving transit times is also important due to the high percentage of transit users. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, and reasonable driving fees that improve transit times are preferred. The goal is to enhance transit service without significantly increasing costs for residents."
