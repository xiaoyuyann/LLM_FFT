    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a median income of $68,091 and a per capita income of $32,132. The income distribution shows a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000, indicating a need for affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income range, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their ability to spend on other necessities and discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a high percentage of residents who drive alone (59.2%) and a smaller percentage using transit (12.5%). This suggests a need for policies that improve transit accessibility and affordability to encourage more transit use and reduce car dependency.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and current transportation habits, the focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden lower-income households. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, while also considering the environmental benefits of reduced congestion."
