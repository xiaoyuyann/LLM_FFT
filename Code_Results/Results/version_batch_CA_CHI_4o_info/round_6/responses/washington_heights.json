    "disposable_income": "The median income in Washington Heights is $66,797, with a per capita income of $29,673. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a considerable percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could impact spending on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "58.2% of residents drive alone, while 22.3% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 83.2% of households owning at least one vehicle. However, a notable portion of the population relies on transit, indicating the importance of affordable and efficient public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance affordability and service improvement. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, enhancing overall accessibility without significantly increasing the financial burden on residents."
