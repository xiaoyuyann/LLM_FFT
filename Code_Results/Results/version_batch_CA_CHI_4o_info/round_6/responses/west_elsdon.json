    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon has a median household income of $64,441 and a per capita income of $27,703. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $74,999, indicating moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 40.5% of households earning less than $50,000, there is a need to balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "59.6% of residents drive alone, while 12.9% use transit. The mean commute time is 36.3 minutes. Improving transit times could benefit the community, but cost increases must be carefully considered due to the moderate income levels.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high percentage of car ownership and driving alone, policies that reduce driving time and encourage transit use are beneficial. However, the community's moderate income levels necessitate keeping costs low. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized, as they improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is also considered to ensure affordability."
