    "disposable_income": "The median income is $69,810, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with a need to balance costs carefully.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a significant portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and taxes, as these could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "24.5% of the population uses transit, and 43.8% drive alone. A significant portion of the community relies on transit, so policies that improve transit times and affordability are crucial. Car ownership is moderate, with 23.8% having no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on transit and moderate disposable income, policies that reduce transit fares and improve transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Driver fees are considered to reduce congestion and improve transit times, but they should not be too high to avoid burdening drivers. The selected policies aim to balance improved transit service with affordability and minimal impact on discretionary income."
