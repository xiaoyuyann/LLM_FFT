    "disposable_income": "Humboldt Park has a median household income of $51,105 and a per capita income of $25,358. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact these households' ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "25% of households do not own a vehicle, and 20.1% of residents use transit to commute. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community, as a significant portion relies on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies that minimize fare increases while improving transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to reduce the financial burden on households. Driver fees are considered acceptable if they significantly reduce car travel times and improve transit services, as this could encourage a shift from driving to transit, benefiting the community by reducing congestion and emissions."
