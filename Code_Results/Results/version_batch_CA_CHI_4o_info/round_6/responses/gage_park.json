    "accessibility": "59.6% of residents drive alone, while 17.9% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, but 20.5% of households have no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit for a portion of the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that minimize costs while improving transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance affordability and service improvement. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times for both drivers and transit users while keeping costs manageable for the community."
