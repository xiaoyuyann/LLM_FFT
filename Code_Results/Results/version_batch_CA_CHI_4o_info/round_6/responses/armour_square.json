    "disposable_income": "A significant portion of the community earns less than $25,000 (31.1%), with a substantial number also in the $25,000â€“$49,999 range (19.7%). This indicates limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many residents likely prioritize essential expenses, with limited room for discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their budgets.",
    "accessibility": "With 24.4% of residents using transit and 33.9% without a vehicle, affordable and efficient public transportation is crucial. The community also has a high percentage of Asian residents (71.7%), who may rely on transit for cultural and community connections.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transit suggest prioritizing policies with lower fares and taxes to minimize financial strain. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of affordability. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes, which still improve transit times, are preferred. The goal is to balance cost savings with improved transit efficiency, considering the high percentage of residents without vehicles and those who use transit."
