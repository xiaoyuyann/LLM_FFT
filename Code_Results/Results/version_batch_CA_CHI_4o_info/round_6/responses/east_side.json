    "disposable_income": "The median household income in East Side is $61,898, with a per capita income of $25,646. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $49,999, indicating moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 26.7% of households earning between $25,000 and $49,999, and 15.1% earning less than $25,000, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their discretionary spending on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (68.4%) drive alone, with only 7.7% using transit. The mean commute time is 36.4 minutes, suggesting that improvements in transit times could benefit the community, but the reliance on cars indicates that driver fees could be burdensome.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on driving and moderate income levels, policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with reasonable travel times are preferred. A lower sales tax is also favorable to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The goal is to improve transit accessibility without significantly increasing costs for drivers, who make up the majority of commuters."
