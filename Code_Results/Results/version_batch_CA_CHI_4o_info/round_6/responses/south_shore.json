    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Shore is $39,649, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred to maintain essential consumption.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the population relies on transit (32.8%) and a notable percentage has no vehicle (37.8%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The community would benefit from policies that balance improved transit services with affordability. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times without excessive cost increases, are preferred."
