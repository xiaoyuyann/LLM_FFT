    "disposable_income": "Uptown has a median income of $66,871 and a per capita income of $49,783. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to changes in transportation costs, especially those in lower income brackets. The community's spending on transportation should not significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Uptown has a high percentage of residents using transit (34.9%) and a significant number without vehicles (42.1%). This suggests that transit accessibility is crucial, and improvements in transit services could benefit a large portion of the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and the need for affordability, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Proposals that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs are favored. The community's high transit usage and lower vehicle ownership suggest that improving transit services while keeping costs low is essential. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times and reduce congestion, are preferred."
