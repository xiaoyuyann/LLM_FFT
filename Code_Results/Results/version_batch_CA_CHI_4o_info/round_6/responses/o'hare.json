    "disposable_income": "O'Hare is a mixed-income area with a range of income levels, but generally has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to the airport and associated employment opportunities.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in O'Hare likely have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on housing, transportation, and leisure activities. The community's spending patterns are influenced by its diverse population and employment opportunities.",
    "accessibility": "O'Hare has good accessibility to resources and services due to its proximity to major transportation hubs, including the airport and highways. Public transit options are available but may not be as convenient as driving for some residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it results in better transit services. However, keeping transit fares low is important to encourage public transit use. A moderate driver fee can help reduce congestion and improve air quality. The focus is on balancing costs with improved transit times and services, while considering the community's reliance on both driving and public transit."
