    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen has a high median income of $139,046 and a per capita income of $70,693, indicating a relatively high level of disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 46.5% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community likely has significant discretionary spending power. However, a portion of the population (18.3%) earns less than $50,000, which should be considered when evaluating fare and tax impacts.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (57.9%) drive alone, with only 10.5% using transit. Car ownership is high, with 62.3% of households owning two or more vehicles. This suggests that policies affecting driving costs and transit improvements could influence travel behavior.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and preference for driving, policies that reduce driving time and improve transit efficiency are prioritized. The community's high income allows for some flexibility in accepting higher taxes or fees if they result in significant improvements in travel time and service quality. However, the impact on lower-income residents must be considered, so policies with lower fares are preferred. Balancing these factors, the selected policies aim to improve transit times and reduce driving congestion while considering the financial impact on residents."
