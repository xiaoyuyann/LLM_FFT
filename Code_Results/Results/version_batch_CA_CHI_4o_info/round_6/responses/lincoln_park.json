    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Park has a high median household income of $134,277 and a per capita income of $109,538, indicating a relatively high level of disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 44.8% of households earning $150,000 and over, residents likely have significant discretionary spending power. However, a portion of the population (11.4%) earns less than $25,000, which should be considered when evaluating fare and fee impacts.",
    "accessibility": "Lincoln Park has a high percentage of residents using transit (33.4%) and a significant portion without vehicles (32.3%). This suggests a strong reliance on public transportation, making transit accessibility and affordability crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and the community's overall high income, proposals that improve transit times and maintain reasonable costs are prioritized. A balance between transit fare, sales tax, and driving fees is essential to ensure accessibility without overly burdening lower-income residents. Proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to support transit improvements while considering the community's financial capacity."
