    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49.5% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has a high capacity for discretionary spending. However, the community may still be sensitive to changes in costs that affect their lifestyle and consumption patterns.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a diverse mode of transportation usage with 38.6% driving alone and 20% using transit. The high percentage of work-from-home (29.2%) suggests flexibility in commuting needs. Car ownership is high, with 87.4% of households owning at least one vehicle, indicating a reliance on personal vehicles but also a significant portion using public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can absorb moderate increases in taxes and fees if they result in improved transit services and reduced congestion. The preference is for policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees to encourage transit use while maintaining reasonable travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize impact on discretionary spending. The community values efficient transit options to reduce travel time and congestion, aligning with their high car ownership and transit usage."
