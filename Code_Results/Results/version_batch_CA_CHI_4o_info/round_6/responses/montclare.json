    "disposable_income": "The median income in Montclare is $69,038, with a per capita income of $33,574. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 20.3% of households earning less than $25,000, affordability is crucial. The community's spending on transportation should not significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Montclare has a high rate of car ownership, with 74.9% driving alone to work. Only 4.4% use transit, suggesting that improvements in transit could benefit those without vehicles and potentially reduce congestion.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and low transit usage, policies that improve transit times and affordability are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on balancing costs with improved accessibility and reduced travel times."
