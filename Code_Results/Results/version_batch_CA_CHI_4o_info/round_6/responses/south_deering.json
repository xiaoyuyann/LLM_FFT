    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Deering is $34,814, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens, such as lower fares and taxes, are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on driving (57.2%) and transit (23.7%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (24%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized to ensure affordability. Driver fees are considered to reduce congestion and improve transit times, but they must be balanced against the community's financial constraints. The selected policies aim to enhance transit accessibility and affordability, while also considering the impact on driving costs."
