    "disposable_income": "The median income in West Lawn is $69,647, with a per capita income of $25,786. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $149,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as fares and fees, which could impact their discretionary spending on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (63.4%) or carpool (18.0%), with only 9.8% using transit. This suggests that while transit improvements could benefit some, policies that significantly increase driving costs might disproportionately affect the majority who rely on cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on driving and moderate income levels, policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driving fees with reasonable travel times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The goal is to improve transit times to encourage more usage while not overly burdening drivers with high fees. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driving fees, which also offer reduced travel times, are ranked higher."
