    "disposable_income": "The median income in Woodlawn is $29,969, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the population relies on transit (24.3%) and a notable percentage has no vehicle (38.1%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. The community would benefit from reduced travel times and improved transit services, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times without imposing high costs, are preferred. The balance between improving transit service and maintaining affordability is key."
