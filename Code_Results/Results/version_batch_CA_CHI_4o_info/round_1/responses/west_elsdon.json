    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon has a median household income of $64,441 and a per capita income of $27,703. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $74,999, indicating moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 40.5% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely limited. The community may be sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as fares and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (59.6%), with 12.9% using transit. Car ownership is high, with 86.5% of households owning at least one vehicle. The mean commute time is 36.3 minutes, suggesting a reliance on efficient transportation options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and high car ownership, policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with reasonable travel times are preferred. A lower sales tax is also favorable to maintain discretionary spending. The community would benefit from reduced travel times to improve accessibility and efficiency. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized."
