    "disposable_income": "The median income is $69,810, with a per capita income of $36,151. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 18.4% earning less than $25,000 and 19.3% earning between $25,000 and $49,999, a large segment of the community may have limited discretionary spending. Thus, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferable to maintain disposable income for other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "24.5% of the population uses transit, and 43.8% drive alone. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility. A significant portion of households (23.8%) do not own a vehicle, emphasizing the importance of affordable and efficient public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both transit and driving, the focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, benefiting the large transit-using population. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times while keeping costs manageable for lower-income residents."
