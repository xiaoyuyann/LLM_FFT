    "disposable_income": "Irving Park has a relatively high median income of $86,849 and a per capita income of $48,320. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a portion of the community may be sensitive to increased costs from higher taxes or fees. However, the higher income brackets suggest some capacity to absorb moderate increases in costs.",
    "accessibility": "49.6% of residents drive alone, while 18.5% use transit. Car ownership is high, with 86.1% of households owning at least one vehicle. This suggests a reliance on both driving and transit, with a need for efficient and cost-effective options for both modes.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income levels and transportation habits, the focus is on balancing cost with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable given the community's income levels, as it supports better transit services. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, while ensuring the community can sustain the financial impact."
