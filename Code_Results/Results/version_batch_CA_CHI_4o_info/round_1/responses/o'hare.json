    "disposable_income": "O'Hare is a community with a moderate to high disposable income, given its proximity to the airport and associated employment opportunities.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents likely have a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on travel, dining, and other services being significant due to the area's connectivity and economic activity.",
    "accessibility": "O'Hare has good accessibility to resources and services, with strong transit links and road networks due to its location near the airport. However, transit times are currently longer compared to driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it results in better transit services. Reducing transit times is crucial to make public transportation more attractive. A balance between fare, tax, and driving fees is needed to ensure affordability while improving service. Proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting discretionary spending. Proposals that reduce car travel time are also prioritized to alleviate congestion and emissions."
