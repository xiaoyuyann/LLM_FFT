    "disposable_income": "Mount Greenwood has a relatively high median income of $113,328 and a per capita income of $47,744. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning above $100,000, the community likely has a substantial amount of discretionary income. However, any increase in taxes or fees could still impact consumption patterns, especially for those in lower income brackets.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (82.2%), with a small percentage using transit (4.2%). This suggests that car travel is the dominant mode of transportation, and any policy that increases driving costs could have a significant impact. However, improving transit could provide more options for those without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and preference for driving, policies that minimize driving fees while slightly increasing transit fares and taxes could be more acceptable. The community's high income allows for some flexibility in absorbing costs, but minimizing disruption to driving habits is crucial. Therefore, policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs for drivers are prioritized. A moderate increase in sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as it aligns with the community's ability to absorb such costs."
