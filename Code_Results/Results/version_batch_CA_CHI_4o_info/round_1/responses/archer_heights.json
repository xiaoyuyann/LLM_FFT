    "disposable_income": "A significant portion of the community earns less than $50,000, with 46.3% of households in this bracket. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of the population in lower income brackets, discretionary spending is likely limited. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a high reliance on driving, with 58.7% driving alone and 19.4% carpooling. Only 13.1% use transit, indicating that improvements in transit could benefit a minority but could also encourage a shift from driving if transit becomes more attractive.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on driving, policies that reduce travel time and cost for both drivers and transit users are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting those who drive. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden low-income households."
