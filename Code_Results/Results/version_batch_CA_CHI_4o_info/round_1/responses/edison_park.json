    "disposable_income": "Edison Park has a relatively high median income of $120,024 and a per capita income of $57,872. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. However, a notable portion of the population (22.6%) earns less than $50,000, so affordability of transit and driving fees is still a consideration.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (69.1%) drive alone, indicating a strong reliance on personal vehicles. Only 8.4% use transit, suggesting that improvements in transit could benefit a minority but potentially reduce congestion for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and cost are prioritized. However, improving transit is also important to provide alternatives and reduce congestion. A balance between low taxes, reasonable transit fares, and moderate driving fees is ideal to maintain affordability while enhancing transit services. The selected policies aim to reduce travel time for both drivers and transit users, with a focus on maintaining low costs for the majority who drive."
