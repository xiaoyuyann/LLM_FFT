    "disposable_income": "Chatham has a median income of $39,348 and a per capita income of $28,801. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 32.8% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact these households.",
    "accessibility": "Chatham has a high percentage of residents using transit (27.3%) and a significant portion without vehicles (31.8%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Proposals with a balance of lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting both transit users and drivers."
