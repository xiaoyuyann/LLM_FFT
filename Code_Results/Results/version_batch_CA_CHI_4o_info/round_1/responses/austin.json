    "disposable_income": "The median income in Austin is $40,086, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 35.2% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens, such as lower fares and taxes, are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "Austin has a high percentage of residents using transit (23.7%) and a significant portion without vehicles (30.6%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial, while also considering the impact on those who drive.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Balancing transit improvements with affordability is key. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times without excessive cost increases, are ranked higher."
