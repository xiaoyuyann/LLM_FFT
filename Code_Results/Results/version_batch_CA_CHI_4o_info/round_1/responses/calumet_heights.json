    "disposable_income": "The median income in Calumet Heights is $68,436, with a per capita income of $39,867. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 20.6% of households earning less than $25,000, a substantial portion of the community may have limited discretionary spending. The community needs to balance transportation costs with other essential expenses.",
    "accessibility": "52.3% of residents drive alone, while 19.5% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 47.9% owning one vehicle and 26.4% owning two. Accessibility to resources is moderately reliant on both driving and transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and the need to balance costs, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred. Reducing transit time is also important to encourage transit use. A lower driving fee can help those who rely on cars. The community's reliance on both driving and transit suggests a balanced approach is needed. Proposals with a $0.75 fare and moderate driving fees are prioritized to maintain affordability while improving transit times."
