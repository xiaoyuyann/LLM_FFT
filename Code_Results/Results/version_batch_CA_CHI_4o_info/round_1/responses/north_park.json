    "discretionary_consumption": "With a substantial portion of the population earning above $100,000, there is likely a higher level of discretionary consumption. However, 17.7% of households earn less than $25,000, indicating some income disparity.",
    "accessibility": "55.6% of residents drive alone, and 17.5% use transit, indicating a reliance on both modes of transportation. The mean commute time is 34 minutes, suggesting moderate accessibility. Car ownership is high, with 85.4% of households having at least one vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and cost are favorable. However, with a significant portion using transit, improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares is also important. Balancing the sales tax impact on discretionary spending is crucial, especially for lower-income households. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax, reduced transit fares, and reasonable driving fees that improve travel times are prioritized."
