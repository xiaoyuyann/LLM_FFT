    "disposable_income": "The median income in Hegewisch is $58,647, with a per capita income of $31,457. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.6% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. The community must balance transportation costs with other essential expenses.",
    "accessibility": "65.2% of residents drive alone, while only 10.8% use transit. Car ownership is high, with 87.4% of households owning at least one vehicle. This suggests a reliance on driving, but improving transit could benefit those without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income constraints and reliance on driving, policies that reduce travel time and cost for both drivers and transit users are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to balance improved transit services with affordability for residents."
