    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park has a relatively high median household income of $90,740 and a per capita income of $42,024. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high median income, residents likely have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, which means affordability of transit and driving fees is still a concern for some households.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (61.7%), with a smaller portion using transit (13.4%). Car ownership is high, with 90.2% of households owning at least one vehicle. This suggests that while transit improvements are beneficial, driving remains a primary mode of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and preference for driving, policies that reduce driving time and cost are prioritized. However, improving transit is also important to support the 13.4% who rely on it and to potentially reduce congestion. Balancing the sales tax impact on discretionary spending is crucial, especially for lower-income households. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax, lower transit fares, and reasonable driving fees are preferred to ensure affordability and improved service."
