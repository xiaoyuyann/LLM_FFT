    "disposable_income": "The median income in Burnside is $46,711, with a significant portion of households earning between $25,000 and $49,999. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with a need to balance costs carefully.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, a large portion of the community may have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "With 27.6% of residents using transit and 38.7% having no vehicle, improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial. However, 40.3% drive alone, indicating a need to balance transit improvements with reasonable driving costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community's high reliance on transit and moderate income levels suggest prioritizing policies that lower transit fares and maintain reasonable driving costs. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized, as they improve transit times and accessibility without significantly increasing costs for drivers. The selected proposals aim to balance improved transit service with affordability for both transit users and drivers."
