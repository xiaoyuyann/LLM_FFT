    "disposable_income": "Edgewater has a median income of $67,796 and a per capita income of $51,717. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Edgewater has a high percentage of residents using transit (33.2%) and a significant portion without vehicles (38.8%). This suggests a strong reliance on public transportation, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the need to maintain affordability, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized. A balance between improving transit efficiency and maintaining low costs is essential. Proposals with a 0.5% sales tax are preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The top choices aim to reduce transit times while keeping fares affordable, considering the community's income distribution and reliance on public transit."
