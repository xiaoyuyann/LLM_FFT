    "disposable_income": "The median income in Avalon Park is $54,139, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests that disposable income is limited for many residents, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 24% of households earning less than $25,000, a large portion of the community may prioritize essential spending over discretionary consumption. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are likely to be preferred.",
    "accessibility": "With 24.1% of residents using transit and 58.5% driving alone, both transit and driving are important. However, a significant portion of the community relies on transit, so improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both transit and driving, policies that balance affordability with improved transit services are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services, as this can benefit a large portion of the community. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while considering the community's limited disposable income."
