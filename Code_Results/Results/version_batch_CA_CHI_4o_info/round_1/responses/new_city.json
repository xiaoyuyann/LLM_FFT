    "disposable_income": "The median income in New City is $40,959, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the population relies on driving (53.7%) and transit (17.9%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (24.5%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income constraints and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to minimize financial burden while enhancing transit services. Driver fees are considered to reduce congestion and improve transit times, but they should not be too high to avoid excessive costs for drivers."
