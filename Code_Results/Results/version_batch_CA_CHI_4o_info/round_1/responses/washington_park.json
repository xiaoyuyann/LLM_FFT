    "disposable_income": "Washington Park has a median income of $26,014 and a per capita income of $19,948. A significant portion of the population (49.3%) earns less than $25,000 annually, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With nearly half of the population earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "42.8% of households do not own a vehicle, and 32.3% of the population uses transit. This suggests a high reliance on public transportation, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The community would benefit from policies that improve transit efficiency without imposing high financial burdens. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance cost and service improvement."
