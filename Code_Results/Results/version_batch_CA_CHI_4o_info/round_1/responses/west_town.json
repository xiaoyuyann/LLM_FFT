    "disposable_income": "West Town has a high median income of $128,717 and a per capita income of $82,088, indicating a relatively affluent community with significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 43.9% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has a high capacity for discretionary spending. However, a significant portion of the population (9.8%) earns less than $25,000, suggesting some income diversity.",
    "accessibility": "West Town has a diverse mode of transportation usage with 23.2% using transit and 35.1% driving alone. The community also has a high percentage of residents working from home (26.3%), reducing daily commuting needs.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, the community can absorb moderate increases in taxes and fees. However, improving transit times is crucial for the 23.2% who rely on it. A balance between maintaining low costs for lower-income residents and improving transit efficiency is needed. Proposals with moderate taxes and fees that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. The community's high car ownership and driving rates also necessitate consideration of driving fees to reduce congestion and emissions."
