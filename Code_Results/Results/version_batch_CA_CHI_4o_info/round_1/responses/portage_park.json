    "disposable_income": "Portage Park has a median income of $85,473 and a per capita income of $38,488. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a substantial portion of the population earning over $100,000, residents likely have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption. However, 30.8% of households earn less than $50,000, which suggests that affordability is still a concern for a significant minority.",
    "accessibility": "62.9% of residents drive alone, indicating a strong reliance on cars. Only 14% use transit, suggesting that improvements in transit could benefit the community. The mean commute time is 37.1 minutes, which is relatively high, indicating potential benefits from reduced travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and cost are favorable. However, improving transit is also important to provide alternatives and reduce congestion. A balance between low transit fares and moderate driver fees is ideal to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable given the community's income levels, as it supports better transit services. Therefore, proposals that offer reduced travel times for both modes, with moderate costs, are prioritized."
