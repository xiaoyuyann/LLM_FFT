    "disposable_income": "The median income in Montclare is $69,038, with a per capita income of $33,574. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 20.3% of households earning less than $25,000, a large portion of the community may have limited discretionary spending. Therefore, policies that minimize additional costs are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (74.9%) drive alone, with only 4.4% using transit. This suggests a strong reliance on cars, but improvements in transit could encourage a shift, especially if transit becomes more time-efficient and affordable.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on driving and the need to maintain affordability, policies that reduce travel time and cost for both drivers and transit users are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden low-income households. The selected policies aim to balance these factors, improving transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for the community."
