    "disposable_income": "Hyde Park has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents, particularly when it comes to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a substantial percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely limited. Therefore, policies that minimize additional financial burdens, such as lower fares and taxes, would be more favorable.",
    "accessibility": "Hyde Park has a high percentage of residents using transit (22.5%) and walking/biking (29.4%), with a significant portion of households not owning a vehicle (43.4%). This indicates a strong reliance on public transit and non-motorized modes of transportation, making transit accessibility and affordability crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the significant portion of the population with limited disposable income, policies that reduce transit fares and maintain or slightly increase taxes to improve transit services are prioritized. Lower driving fees are less critical due to the lower percentage of residents driving alone. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit service, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and limited discretionary income."
