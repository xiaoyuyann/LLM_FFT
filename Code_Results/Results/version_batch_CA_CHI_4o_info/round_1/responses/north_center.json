    "disposable_income": "North Center has a high median income of $148,585 and a per capita income of $88,926, indicating a relatively high level of disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49.5% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has significant discretionary spending power. However, a portion of the population still earns less than $50,000, which should be considered when evaluating fare and fee impacts.",
    "accessibility": "38.6% of residents drive alone, and 20% use transit, indicating a balanced reliance on both modes. The community has a high percentage of households with at least one vehicle, but also a notable portion without any vehicle (12.6%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, the community can afford moderate increases in taxes and fees if they result in significant improvements in transit service and reduced travel times. The goal is to balance the cost of living with improved accessibility and reduced congestion. Proposals with moderate taxes and fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. The community's high income allows for some flexibility in supporting transit improvements through higher taxes and fees, but the impact on lower-income residents is also considered."
