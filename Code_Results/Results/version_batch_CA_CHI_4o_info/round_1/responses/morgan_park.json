    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a median household income of $71,683 and a per capita income of $39,283. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $49,999, with 39.5% of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with some households potentially sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, discretionary spending varies. Households with higher incomes may have more flexibility, but those earning less than $50,000 may prioritize essential expenses. The community's spending on transportation should be balanced to avoid burdening lower-income households.",
    "accessibility": "Morgan Park has a high car ownership rate, with 89% of households having at least one vehicle. However, only 9.5% of residents use transit, indicating a reliance on driving. Improving transit accessibility and reducing travel times could encourage more residents to use public transportation, benefiting those without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and reliance on driving, policies that reduce travel time and cost for both drivers and transit users are prioritized. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting discretionary spending. A balanced sales tax rate is preferred to support transit improvements without overly burdening residents. The selected policies aim to improve transit efficiency, reduce congestion, and maintain affordability for all income levels."
