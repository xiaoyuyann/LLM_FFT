    "disposable_income": "Kenwood has a median income of $58,052 and a per capita income of $55,311. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.4% of households earning less than $25,000, any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact discretionary spending. The community must balance between affordable transit fares and the benefits of improved services.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has a high percentage of residents using transit (23.1%) and a significant portion without vehicles (33.1%). Improving transit times and maintaining low fares are crucial for accessibility, especially for those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the need for affordability, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. The community benefits from reduced travel times and improved transit services, but must avoid high costs that could burden low-income residents. Proposals with a balance of lower fares, moderate taxes, and reasonable driving fees are preferred to enhance transit service without significantly impacting disposable income."
