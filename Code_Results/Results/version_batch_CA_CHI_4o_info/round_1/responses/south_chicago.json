    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Chicago is $43,936, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $22,912, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "31.6% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% of residents use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial, but the community also has a high percentage of residents who drive alone (58.2%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on both transit and driving, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Proposals with moderate driver fees are considered to encourage a shift to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The top-ranked proposals aim to improve transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents."
