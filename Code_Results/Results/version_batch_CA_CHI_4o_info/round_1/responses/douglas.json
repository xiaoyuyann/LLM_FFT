    "disposable_income": "The median income in Douglas is $43,528, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making cost-sensitive policies important.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "44.4% of households do not own a vehicle, and 26.4% of residents use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community, as many rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, the community would benefit from policies that reduce transit fares and maintain or slightly increase taxes to improve transit services. A moderate driver fee could help reduce congestion and improve transit times without overly burdening drivers. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit service, considering the community's income constraints and reliance on public transportation."
