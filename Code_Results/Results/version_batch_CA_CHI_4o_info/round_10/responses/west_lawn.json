    "disposable_income": "The median income in West Lawn is $69,647, with a per capita income of $25,786. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $99,999, indicating moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 36.9% of households earning less than $50,000, there is a need to balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees.",
    "accessibility": "63.4% of residents drive alone, while 9.8% use transit. Car ownership is high, with 56.3% owning two or more vehicles. This suggests a reliance on driving, but there is potential to improve transit usage with better services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and high car ownership, policies that reduce travel time and cost for both drivers and transit users are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A balanced approach with moderate sales tax is preferred to support transit improvements without overly burdening residents."
