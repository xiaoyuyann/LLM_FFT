    "disposable_income": "North Center has a high median income of $148,585 and a per capita income of $88,926, indicating a relatively affluent community with significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49.5% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has a high capacity for discretionary spending. However, the community is likely sensitive to changes in costs that could impact their lifestyle choices.",
    "accessibility": "38.6% of residents drive alone, and 20% use transit, indicating a balanced reliance on both modes. The community has a moderate level of car ownership, with 49.8% owning one vehicle and 33% owning two vehicles. Accessibility improvements in transit could benefit a significant portion of the population.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can absorb moderate increases in taxes and fees if they result in significant improvements in transit service and reduced travel times. The focus is on balancing cost with improved accessibility and reduced congestion. Proposals with higher driver fees and moderate transit fares are preferred to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between cost, improved transit times, and reduced driving times."
