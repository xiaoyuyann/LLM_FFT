    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can absorb moderate increases in taxes and fees if they lead to improved transit services.

Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is necessary to maintain accessibility and affordability."
