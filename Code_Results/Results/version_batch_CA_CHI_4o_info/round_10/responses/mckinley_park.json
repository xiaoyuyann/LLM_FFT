    "disposable_income": "The median income in McKinley Park is $70,411, with a per capita income of $32,106. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $149,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to changes in transportation costs. The community's discretionary spending could be impacted by higher transit fares, driver fees, or sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "51.5% of residents drive alone, while 21.7% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 87.8% of households owning at least one vehicle. This suggests that both driving and transit are important modes of transportation for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost and accessibility. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without significantly impacting those who drive. A moderate sales tax would support transit improvements without overly burdening residents. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a balanced sales tax, are prioritized."
