    "disposable_income": "Irving Park has a relatively high median income of $86,849 and a per capita income of $48,320. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning over $100,000, discretionary spending is likely robust. However, 28.6% of households earn less than $50,000, suggesting that affordability is still a concern for a portion of the community.",
    "accessibility": "49.6% of residents drive alone, and 18.5% use transit, indicating a balanced reliance on both modes. The community has a moderate level of car ownership, with 13.9% of households having no vehicle, which highlights the importance of affordable and efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and transportation preferences, the focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening lower-income residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable given the community's income levels, as it supports better transit services. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, while also considering the environmental benefits of reduced congestion."
