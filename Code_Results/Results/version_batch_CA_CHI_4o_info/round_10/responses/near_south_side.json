    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side has a high median household income of $124,558 and a per capita income of $94,087, indicating a relatively affluent community with significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 43.7% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community likely has a high level of discretionary consumption. However, 12.9% of households earn less than $25,000, suggesting some income disparity.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a balanced mode of transportation with 41.9% driving alone and 22.7% using transit. A significant portion of the population works from home (22.7%), reducing daily commuting needs. Car ownership is moderate, with 22.4% of households having no vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, the community can afford higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The focus is on improving transit efficiency and reducing car travel time, as a significant portion of the population uses these modes. A moderate sales tax is acceptable to support transit improvements, but it should not overly burden lower-income residents. The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and service improvement."
