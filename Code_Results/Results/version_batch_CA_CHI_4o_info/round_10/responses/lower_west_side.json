    "disposable_income": "The median income is $69,810, with a per capita income of $36,151. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "24.5% of residents use transit, and 43.8% drive alone. A significant portion of the community relies on transit, but car ownership is also prevalent, with 76.2% of households owning at least one vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on both transit and driving, policies that balance affordability and improved transit services are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use while reducing congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. The top-ranked proposals aim to reduce travel times for both modes while keeping costs manageable for lower-income residents."
