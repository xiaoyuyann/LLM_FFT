    "disposable_income": "The community has a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000, with 46.3% of households falling into this category. This suggests that disposable income is limited for a large segment of the population.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, discretionary spending is likely constrained, with a focus on essential goods and services. A higher sales tax or transit fare could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "With 58.7% of residents driving alone and 13.1% using transit, both modes of transportation are important. However, a notable 23.7% of households do not own a vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit. Improving transit times and affordability could benefit these residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community's income distribution and car ownership patterns suggest a need to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without overly burdening low-income households. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could benefit the 23.7% of households without vehicles. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, while considering the community's financial constraints."
