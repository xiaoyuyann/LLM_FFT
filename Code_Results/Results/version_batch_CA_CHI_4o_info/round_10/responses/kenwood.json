    "disposable_income": "Kenwood has a median income of $58,052 and a per capita income of $55,311. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating a need for affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.4% of households earning less than $25,000, affordability is crucial. A lower transit fare and minimal driver fees would help maintain discretionary spending on essentials.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has a high percentage of residents using transit (23.1%) and a significant portion without vehicles (33.1%). Improving transit times and maintaining low costs are essential for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the need for affordability, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized. A balance between improving transit times and keeping costs low is crucial. The community's income distribution suggests that lower fares and taxes would benefit a larger portion of the population. Proposals with a 0.5% tax and $0.75 fare are preferred to minimize the financial burden while slightly increasing driver fees to improve transit services and reduce congestion."
