    "disposable_income": "The median income in Oakland is $27,693, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "41.7% of households do not own a vehicle, and 19.9% use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial, but driving is still the primary mode for 48.2% of commuters.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on transit, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. A balance between improving transit services and minimizing financial impact is essential. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents."
