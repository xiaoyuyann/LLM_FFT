    "disposable_income": "Edison Park has a relatively high median income of $120,024 and a per capita income of $57,872. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. However, a portion of the population earns less than $50,000, so affordability of transit and driving fees is still a consideration.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (69.1%), with only 8.4% using transit. Car ownership is high, with 61% owning two or more vehicles. This suggests that while transit improvements are beneficial, driving remains the primary mode of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and preference for driving, policies that reduce driving time and cost are prioritized. However, improving transit is also important to provide alternatives and reduce congestion. A balance between low taxes, reasonable transit fares, and moderate driving fees is ideal to maintain affordability while enhancing transit services. The selected policies aim to reduce travel time for both modes while considering the financial impact on residents."
