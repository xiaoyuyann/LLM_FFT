    "disposable_income": "The median income in Woodlawn is $29,969, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens, such as lower fares and taxes, are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the population relies on transit (24.3%) and a notable percentage has no vehicle (38.1%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. The goal is to enhance transit accessibility while minimizing financial strain. Proposals with higher driver fees are considered to encourage a shift from driving to transit, potentially reducing congestion and improving transit times. The selected policies balance affordability, improved transit service, and reduced travel times."
