    "disposable_income": "The median income in Brighton Park is $52,145, with a per capita income of $22,361. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "58.8% of residents drive alone, while 15.1% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 84.6% of households owning at least one vehicle. However, 15.4% of households have no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit for some.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and the need to balance costs, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred. Reducing transit times is also important to improve accessibility for those reliant on public transit. Proposals with higher driver fees are considered to encourage a shift to transit, potentially reducing congestion and emissions. The selected proposals aim to balance affordability, improved transit service, and reduced travel times."
