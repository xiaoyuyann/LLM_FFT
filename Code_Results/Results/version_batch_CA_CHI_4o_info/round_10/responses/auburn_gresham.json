    "disposable_income": "The median income in Auburn Gresham is $41,000, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $23,557, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "21.1% of residents use transit, and 57.5% drive alone. Improving transit times and reducing costs could benefit a large portion of the community, especially those without vehicles (29.9%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that reduce costs while improving transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance affordability and service improvement. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to enhance transit accessibility and reduce travel times without imposing significant financial burdens on residents."
