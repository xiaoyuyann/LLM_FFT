    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge has a relatively high median income of $90,374 and a per capita income of $37,983. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high median income, residents likely have a reasonable amount of discretionary income. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, which means that affordability of transportation options is still important for a segment of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (71.2%), with only 7.6% using transit. This suggests that car travel is the dominant mode of transportation, and any policy that increases driving costs significantly could impact a large portion of the community. However, improving transit could benefit those who rely on it and potentially reduce congestion.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and preference for driving, policies that maintain or slightly increase driving costs while improving transit times are favorable. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The community would benefit from reduced congestion and improved transit times, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, policies with moderate driver fees and transit fares, coupled with a lower sales tax, are prioritized. The selected policies aim to balance improved transit service with minimal impact on driving costs and overall affordability."
