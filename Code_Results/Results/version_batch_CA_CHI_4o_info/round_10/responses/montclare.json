    "disposable_income": "Montclare has a median income of $69,038 and a per capita income of $33,574. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, which suggests that affordability is a key concern for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a notable portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as higher fares or driver fees, as these could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of Montclare residents drive alone (74.9%), with only 4.4% using transit. This indicates a strong reliance on cars, but also a potential for transit improvements to attract more users if made more efficient and affordable.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and costs are favorable. However, improving transit could also benefit the community by providing a viable alternative to driving. Balancing lower fares and moderate driver fees with reasonable travel times is crucial. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals that offer reduced travel times for both driving and transit, with lower fares and moderate driver fees, are prioritized."
