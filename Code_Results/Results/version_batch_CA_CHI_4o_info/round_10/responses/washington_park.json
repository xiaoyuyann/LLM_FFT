    "disposable_income": "Washington Park has a median income of $26,014 and a per capita income of $19,948, with nearly half of the households earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies crucial.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of the population earning below $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred to maintain essential consumption levels.",
    "accessibility": "42.8% of households have no vehicle, and 32.3% of residents use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is vital for this community, as it directly impacts a large portion of the population.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The community would benefit from policies that balance improved transit services with affordability. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can encourage a shift from driving to transit, are preferred. The selected policies aim to enhance transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for residents."
