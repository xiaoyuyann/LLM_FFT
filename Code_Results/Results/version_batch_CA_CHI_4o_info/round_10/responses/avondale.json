    "disposable_income": "Avondale has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of households earning above $100,000, indicating a relatively high disposable income for many residents. However, there is also a notable percentage of households earning less than $50,000, suggesting income disparity within the community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a substantial portion of the population earning higher incomes, discretionary consumption is likely robust, allowing for spending on non-essential goods and services. However, the presence of lower-income households means that affordability of transportation options remains important.",
    "accessibility": "Avondale has a mix of transportation modes with nearly half of the population driving alone and a significant portion using transit. The community's accessibility to resources and services is supported by both driving and transit options, but improvements in transit could benefit those without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the income diversity, it's important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening lower-income residents. A moderate sales tax supports transit improvements while minimizing impact on discretionary spending. Proposals with reduced travel times for both transit and driving are prioritized to enhance accessibility and reduce congestion."
