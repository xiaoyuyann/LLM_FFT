    "disposable_income": "The median income in Hermosa is $66,073, with a per capita income of $27,053. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $74,999, indicating moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 37.7% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely limited. The community would be sensitive to increases in costs that affect their daily expenses, such as transit fares and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "60.9% of residents drive alone, while 17.7% use transit. Car ownership is high, with 87.5% of households owning at least one vehicle. This suggests that both driving and transit options are important for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and high car ownership, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The community's reliance on both driving and transit necessitates a balanced approach to policy selection."
