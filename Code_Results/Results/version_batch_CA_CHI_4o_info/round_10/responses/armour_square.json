    "disposable_income": "A significant portion of the community earns less than $25,000 (31.1%), with a substantial number also in the $25,000â€“$49,999 range (19.7%). This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large portion of the population in lower income brackets, discretionary spending is likely limited. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "A notable percentage of the population relies on transit (24.4%) and a significant portion does not own a vehicle (33.9%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times without imposing high costs, are preferred."
