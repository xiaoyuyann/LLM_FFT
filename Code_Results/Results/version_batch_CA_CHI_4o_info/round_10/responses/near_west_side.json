    "disposable_income": "The Near West Side has a relatively high median income of $106,955 and a per capita income of $72,602. A significant portion of the population earns over $150,000, indicating a generally affluent community with a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income distribution, residents likely have a substantial amount of discretionary income. However, 17.9% of the population earns less than $25,000, which means that affordability of transit fares and fees is still a concern for a portion of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a diverse mode of transportation usage: 30.7% drive alone, 18.1% use transit, and 24.1% walk or bike. A significant portion of the community does not own a vehicle (34.3%), indicating a reliance on public transit and non-motorized modes of transport.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income levels, the community can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in better transit services. However, the presence of lower-income residents necessitates keeping transit fares affordable. The community's reliance on transit and non-motorized transport suggests that improving transit times and services is crucial. Therefore, proposals that balance lower fares with moderate taxes and fees, while significantly improving transit times, are prioritized. Proposals with higher driver fees are also considered to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
