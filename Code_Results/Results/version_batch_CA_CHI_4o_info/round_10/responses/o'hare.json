    "disposable_income": "O'Hare is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, but generally has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to the airport and associated employment opportunities.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in O'Hare likely have moderate discretionary spending, with a significant portion of income potentially allocated to housing and transportation due to the area's connectivity and employment opportunities.",
    "accessibility": "O'Hare has good accessibility to resources and services, with strong transit connections due to its proximity to the airport and major highways, making both driving and public transit viable options for residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better service and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The community benefits from reduced congestion and emissions, so policies that encourage transit use and reduce car travel times are prioritized. Balancing these factors, the top proposals are those that offer improved transit times and reasonable costs, while maintaining a lower sales tax to support discretionary spending."
