    "disposable_income": "Clearing has a median household income of $73,778 and a per capita income of $33,089. A significant portion of the population earns between $50,000 and $149,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 22% of households earning between $100,000 and $149,999 and 15.7% earning over $150,000, there is a reasonable level of discretionary consumption. However, 32.8% of households earn less than $50,000, suggesting that affordability is a concern for a substantial segment of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (74.1%) drive alone, indicating a high reliance on cars. Only 6.9% use transit, suggesting limited accessibility or preference for transit. The mean commute time is 31.9 minutes, which is relatively high, indicating potential benefits from reduced travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on driving, policies that reduce car travel time and cost are prioritized. However, improving transit is also important to provide alternatives and reduce congestion. Balancing fare, tax, and driving fees is crucial to ensure affordability while enhancing service quality. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to maintain affordability for lower-income households. Policies that significantly reduce travel time for both modes are prioritized to improve overall accessibility."
