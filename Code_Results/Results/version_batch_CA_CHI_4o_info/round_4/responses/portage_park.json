    "disposable_income": "Portage Park has a relatively high median income of $85,473 and a per capita income of $38,488. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning over $100,000, the community likely has a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption. However, 30.8% of households earn less than $50,000, which suggests that affordability is still a concern for a significant portion of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (62.9%), with only 14% using transit. The mean commute time is 37.1 minutes, indicating a reliance on cars for efficient travel. Improving transit times could encourage more transit use, but car travel is currently dominant.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and reliance on driving, policies that reduce car travel time and cost are favorable. However, improving transit times and affordability is also important to encourage a shift towards public transportation. A balance between low transit fares and moderate driver fees is ideal to support transit improvements without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending, especially for lower-income households."
