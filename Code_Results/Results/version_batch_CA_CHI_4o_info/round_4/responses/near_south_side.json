    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side has a high median household income of $124,558 and a per capita income of $94,087, indicating a relatively affluent community with significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 43.7% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community likely has a high level of discretionary consumption. However, 12.9% of households earn less than $25,000, suggesting some income disparity.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a balanced mode of transportation with 41.9% driving alone and 22.7% using transit. A significant portion of the population works from home (22.7%), reducing daily commuting needs. Car ownership is moderate, with 22.4% of households having no vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, the community can afford higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The community's reliance on both driving and transit suggests a need for balanced improvements in both areas. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary consumption, especially for lower-income residents. Proposals with moderate to high driver fees and transit fares, combined with lower sales taxes, are prioritized to enhance transit services and reduce congestion without significantly impacting discretionary spending."
