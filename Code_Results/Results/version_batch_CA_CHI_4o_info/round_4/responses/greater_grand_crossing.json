    "disposable_income": "The median income is $39,908, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on transit (29.5%) and a notable percentage has no vehicle (36.5%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. The goal is to enhance transit accessibility while minimizing financial strain. Proposals with higher driver fees are considered to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting the community's transit users."
