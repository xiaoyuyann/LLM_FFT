    "disposable_income": "The median income in Douglas is $43,528, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25k (34.8%). This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial to maintain current consumption levels.",
    "accessibility": "44.4% of households have no vehicle, and 26.4% of residents use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial. Reducing transit times and costs would benefit a large portion of the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing transit times is also important to improve accessibility. The community would benefit from policies that balance lower costs with improved transit services, while not significantly increasing the tax burden."
