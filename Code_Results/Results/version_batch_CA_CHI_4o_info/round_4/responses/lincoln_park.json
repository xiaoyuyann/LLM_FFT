    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the community's ability to absorb some cost increases, proposals that improve transit times and services are prioritized. A balance between fare, tax, and driving fees is considered to ensure affordability and service improvement. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to maintain accessibility for lower-income residents while improving transit efficiency. Proposals with higher driving fees are favored to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, aligning with the community's transit-oriented lifestyle."
