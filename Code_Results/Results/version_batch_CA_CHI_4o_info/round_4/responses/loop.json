    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a central business district with a mix of high-income professionals and lower-income service workers. Disposable income varies significantly, but generally, there is a higher average income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Loop have a higher level of discretionary consumption due to the presence of numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options. However, the cost of living is also high.",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent accessibility to resources and services, with extensive public transit options including buses and trains. Walking and biking are also viable options due to the dense urban environment.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high accessibility to public transit and the mixed income levels, the focus is on maintaining or improving transit services while considering the impact on disposable income. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to ensure affordability for lower-income residents, while driver fees can help reduce congestion and emissions. The selected policies aim to balance these factors, prioritizing lower fares and moderate taxes to support transit improvements without overly burdening residents."
