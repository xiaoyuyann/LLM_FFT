    "disposable_income": "Belmont Cragin has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of households earning below $50,000. This suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of households in lower income brackets, discretionary spending is likely limited. Therefore, policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "A majority of residents drive alone, but a notable portion also uses transit. Improving transit times and affordability could benefit those who rely on public transportation, while also considering the impact on drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and transportation preferences, the focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services, as it spreads the cost across all consumers. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while considering the community's financial constraints."
