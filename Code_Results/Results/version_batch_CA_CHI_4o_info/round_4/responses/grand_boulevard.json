    "disposable_income": "The median income is $43,048, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 35.5% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact these households.",
    "accessibility": "21.4% of residents use transit, and 30.3% have no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transportation. Improving transit times and affordability is crucial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, policies that reduce transit fares and improve transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Driver fees are considered to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The selected policies balance affordability, improved transit service, and minimal impact on discretionary income."
