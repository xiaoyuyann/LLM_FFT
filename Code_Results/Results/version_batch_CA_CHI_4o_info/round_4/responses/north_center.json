    "disposable_income": "North Center has a high median income of $148,585 and a per capita income of $88,926, indicating a relatively high level of disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49.5% of households earning $150,000 and over, the community has significant discretionary spending power. However, a portion of the population (8.3%) earns less than $25,000, which should be considered when evaluating fare and fee impacts.",
    "accessibility": "38.6% of residents drive alone, and 20% use transit, indicating a balanced reliance on both modes. The community has a high percentage of households with at least one vehicle (87.4%), suggesting good accessibility by car. However, transit improvements could benefit the 20% who rely on it.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, the community can absorb moderate increases in taxes and fees. However, maintaining or improving transit accessibility is crucial for the 20% who rely on it. Proposals that reduce travel time for both modes while keeping costs reasonable are prioritized. A balance between tax, fare, and fee is sought to ensure transit improvements without overly burdening lower-income residents."
