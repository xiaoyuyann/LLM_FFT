    "accessibility": "52.3% of residents drive alone, while 19.5% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 80.6% of households owning at least one vehicle. Accessibility to resources is moderately reliant on both driving and transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and the need to balance costs, proposals with lower fares and taxes are preferred. However, improving transit times is also crucial for those who rely on public transportation. The community would benefit from reduced travel times and costs, especially for transit users. Therefore, proposals that offer a balance between lower fares, moderate taxes, and improved transit times are prioritized. The decision also considers the potential for reduced congestion and emissions by encouraging transit use through driver fees."
