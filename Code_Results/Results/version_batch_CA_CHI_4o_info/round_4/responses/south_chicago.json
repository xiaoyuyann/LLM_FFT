    "disposable_income": "The median income is $43,936, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 30.9% of households earning less than $25,000, any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact discretionary spending on essentials like food and housing.",
    "accessibility": "23.7% of residents use transit, and 31.6% have no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transportation. Improving transit times and maintaining low fares are crucial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on transit and limited disposable income, policies that reduce transit fares and improve travel times are prioritized. A balance between low fares, moderate taxes, and reasonable driving fees is sought to enhance transit services without overly burdening residents financially. The focus is on minimizing costs for transit users while slightly increasing driver fees to improve transit services and reduce congestion."
