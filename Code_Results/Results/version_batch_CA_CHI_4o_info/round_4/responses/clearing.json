    "disposable_income": "Clearing has a median household income of $73,778 and a per capita income of $33,089. A significant portion of the population earns between $50,000 and $149,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 22% of households earning between $100,000 and $149,999 and 15.7% earning over $150,000, there is a reasonable level of discretionary consumption. However, 32.8% of households earn less than $50,000, suggesting that affordability is a concern for a substantial segment of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (74.1%) drive alone, indicating a high reliance on personal vehicles. Only 6.9% use transit, which suggests that improvements in transit could benefit the community. The mean commute time is 31.9 minutes, which is relatively high, indicating potential benefits from reduced travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on driving, policies that reduce car travel time and cost are prioritized. However, improving transit is also important to provide alternatives and reduce congestion. A balance between low transit fares and moderate driver fees is ideal to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales taxes are preferred."
