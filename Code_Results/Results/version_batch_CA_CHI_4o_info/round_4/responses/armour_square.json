    "disposable_income": "A significant portion of the community earns less than $25,000 (31.1%), with a substantial number also in the $25,000â€“$49,999 range (19.7%). This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large portion of the population in lower income brackets, discretionary spending is likely limited. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "A notable percentage of the community relies on transit (24.4%) and a significant portion has no vehicle (33.9%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial, while also considering the needs of those who drive.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The community would benefit from policies that balance improved transit services with affordability. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times without excessive cost increases, are preferred."
