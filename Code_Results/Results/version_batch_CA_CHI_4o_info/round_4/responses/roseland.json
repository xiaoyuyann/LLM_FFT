    "disposable_income": "The median income in Roseland is $49,808, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests that disposable income is limited, and any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the community's financial well-being.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $24,754, discretionary spending is likely constrained. A large portion of the community's income is likely allocated to essential expenses, leaving limited room for additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on driving (53.9% drive alone) and transit (20.1% use transit) for commuting. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are crucial for accessibility, especially for the 25.9% of households without a vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and lower sales taxes are prioritized to enhance accessibility without significantly burdening the community financially."
