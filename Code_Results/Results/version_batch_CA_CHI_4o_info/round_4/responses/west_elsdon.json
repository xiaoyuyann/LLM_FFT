    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon has a median household income of $64,441, with a significant portion of the population earning between $25,000 and $74,999. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with some households potentially sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, a large portion of the community may prioritize affordability in transportation to maintain their discretionary spending on essentials and other goods.",
    "accessibility": "With 59.6% of residents driving alone and 12.9% using transit, accessibility improvements in transit could benefit a significant portion of the community. However, the high car ownership rate indicates that driving is a primary mode of transportation, so policies should balance improvements in transit with reasonable driving costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community's preference is likely for policies that reduce transit times and costs while maintaining reasonable driving fees. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Given the high percentage of car owners, policies that do not excessively increase driving costs are favored. The top-ranked policies reflect a balance between improving transit accessibility and maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers."
