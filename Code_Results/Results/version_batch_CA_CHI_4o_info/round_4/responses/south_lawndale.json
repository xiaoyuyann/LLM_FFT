    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale has a median household income of $42,010 and a per capita income of $18,001, indicating limited disposable income. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, suggesting that affordability is a key concern.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large portion of the population earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely limited. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact the ability of residents to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "56.5% of residents drive alone, while 15.3% use transit. The community has a moderate reliance on transit, but a significant number of households do not own a vehicle, indicating the importance of affordable and efficient public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and the need for affordable transportation, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals that balance lower costs with improved transit times are favored."
