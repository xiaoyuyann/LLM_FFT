    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial strain while improving transit efficiency. A lower sales tax is also favored to reduce the overall financial burden on residents. The goal is to balance affordability with improved transit services to enhance accessibility without significantly impacting discretionary consumption."
