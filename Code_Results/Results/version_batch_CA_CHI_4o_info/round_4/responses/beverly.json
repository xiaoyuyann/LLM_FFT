    "disposable_income": "Beverly has a high median income of $131,170 and a per capita income of $64,719, indicating a relatively high level of disposable income compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of households earning over $100,000, residents likely have more flexibility in discretionary spending. However, they may still be sensitive to changes in costs that affect their overall budget.",
    "accessibility": "62% of residents drive alone, while 17% use transit. This suggests a strong reliance on personal vehicles, but a notable portion of the population also depends on public transit. Improving transit times could benefit a significant minority, while maintaining reasonable driving conditions is crucial for the majority.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, Beverly residents can absorb moderate increases in costs if they result in significant improvements in service. The focus should be on balancing transit improvements with minimal disruption to driving conditions. Proposals with moderate taxes and fees that improve transit times without drastically increasing costs for drivers are preferred. The community's reliance on driving suggests that proposals with higher driving fees might be less favorable unless they offer substantial transit benefits. Therefore, proposals that offer a balance between improved transit times and moderate cost increases are prioritized."
