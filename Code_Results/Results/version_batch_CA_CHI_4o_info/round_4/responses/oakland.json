    "disposable_income": "The median income in Oakland is $27,693, with a significant portion of the population (47.2%) earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact discretionary spending on essentials like food, housing, and healthcare.",
    "accessibility": "41.7% of households do not own a vehicle, and 19.9% of residents use transit. This suggests a reliance on public transportation, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower fares, moderate taxes, and reasonable driving fees are preferred to enhance transit service without overly burdening residents financially."
