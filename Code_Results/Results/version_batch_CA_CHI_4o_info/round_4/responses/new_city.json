    "disposable_income": "The median income in New City is $40,959, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $21,622, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A large portion of the community relies on driving (53.7%) and transit (17.9%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (24.5%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income constraints and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit service, considering the community's economic profile and transportation needs."
