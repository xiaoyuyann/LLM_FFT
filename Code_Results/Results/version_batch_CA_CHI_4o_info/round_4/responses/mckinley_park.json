    "disposable_income": "The median income in McKinley Park is $70,411, with a per capita income of $32,106. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $149,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community has moderate discretionary spending power. The community is likely sensitive to increases in transit fares and taxes, which could impact their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "51.5% of residents drive alone, while 21.7% use transit. Car ownership is high, with 87.8% of households owning at least one vehicle. This suggests that both driving and transit are important modes of transportation for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income levels and reliance on both driving and transit, the ideal policy would balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it results in better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden the community's spending power. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and moderate sales taxes are prioritized to enhance transit accessibility while maintaining affordability."
