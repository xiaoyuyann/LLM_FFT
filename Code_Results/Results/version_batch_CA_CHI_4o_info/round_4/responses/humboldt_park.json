    "discretionary_consumption": "With 49% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability of these households to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "25% of households do not own a vehicle, and 20.1% of residents use transit to commute. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community, as a significant portion relies on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies that minimize fare increases while improving transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid burdening low-income households. Driver fees are acceptable if they significantly reduce car travel times, benefiting both drivers and transit users by reducing congestion. The selected policies aim to balance affordability, improved transit service, and reduced travel times."
