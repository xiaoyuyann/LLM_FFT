    "disposable_income": "The median income in Auburn Gresham is $41,000, with a significant portion of households earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $23,557, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Auburn Gresham has a high percentage of residents who drive alone (57.5%) and a notable portion using transit (21.1%). Policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs would benefit the community, especially given the 29.9% of households without a vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax and fare, combined with a moderate driving fee, can enhance transit services while minimizing financial strain. The top-ranked policies reflect a preference for reduced transit fares and moderate driver fees to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while keeping the sales tax manageable to avoid burdening low-income households."
