    "disposable_income": "The median income in Chicago Lawn is $43,293, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $20,907, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A large portion of the community relies on driving (57.8%) and carpooling (20.6%), with 14.9% using transit. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (24.3%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income constraints and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Proposals with moderate driver fees are considered to encourage a shift to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The top-ranked proposals offer a balance of reduced travel times and costs, supporting both drivers and transit users while considering the community's financial limitations."
