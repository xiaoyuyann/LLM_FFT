    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Shore is $39,649, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on transit (32.8%) and a notable percentage has no vehicle (37.8%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. The goal is to enhance transit accessibility while minimizing financial burden. Proposals with higher driver fees are considered to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting the majority who rely on public transportation."
