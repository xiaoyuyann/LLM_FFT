    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Deering is $34,814, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $23,084, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "23.7% of residents use transit, and 24% have no vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transportation. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are crucial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. Reducing transit times is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The community would benefit from policies that balance improved transit services with affordability. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times without excessive cost, are preferred."
