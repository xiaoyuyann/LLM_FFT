    "disposable_income": "Kenwood has a median income of $58,052 and a per capita income of $55,311. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating a need for affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.4% of households earning less than $25,000, affordability is crucial. The community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and sales taxes, which could reduce disposable income for other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has a high percentage of residents using transit (23.1%) and a significant portion without vehicles (33.1%). Improving transit times and maintaining low fares would benefit a large segment of the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the need for affordability, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Balancing these factors, the selected proposals aim to improve transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for residents."
