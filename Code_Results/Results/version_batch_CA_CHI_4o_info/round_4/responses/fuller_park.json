    "disposable_income": "The majority of households in Fuller Park have an income of less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income. This suggests that any increase in costs, whether through transit fares, sales taxes, or driving fees, could significantly impact residents' financial situations.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 70% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely minimal. Residents may prioritize essential goods and services, making them sensitive to any policy that increases their cost of living.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on transit (18.7%) and carpooling (22.6%), with 58% of households not owning a vehicle. This indicates a high dependency on affordable and efficient public transportation. Policies that improve transit times and reduce costs would be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low income levels and high reliance on public transit, the community would benefit most from policies that minimize costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and driving fees are prioritized to reduce financial burdens. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between affordability and improved transit times, considering the community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transportation."
