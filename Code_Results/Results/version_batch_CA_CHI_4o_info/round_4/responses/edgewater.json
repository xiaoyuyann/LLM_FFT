    "disposable_income": "Edgewater has a median income of $67,796 and a per capita income of $51,717. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 38.8% of households having no vehicle and 33.2% using transit, the community relies heavily on public transportation. Therefore, lower transit fares would benefit a large portion of the population, allowing more disposable income for other needs.",
    "accessibility": "Edgewater has a high percentage of residents using transit (33.2%) and a significant number working from home (20.8%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility to jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the need for affordability, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. The community benefits from reduced travel times, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Proposals with a balance of lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting both transit users and drivers."
