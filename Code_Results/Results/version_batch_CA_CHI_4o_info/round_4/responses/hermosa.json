    "accessibility": "Hermosa has a relatively high percentage of residents who drive alone (60.9%) and a notable portion using transit (17.7%). This suggests a need for balanced policies that improve transit without overly burdening drivers, as car ownership is prevalent with 87.5% of households owning at least one vehicle.",

Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting drivers. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to balance improved transit services with affordability and accessibility for all residents."
