    "disposable_income": "Logan Square has a relatively high median income of $97,759 and a per capita income of $62,532. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, residents likely have a higher capacity for discretionary spending. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, so affordability of transit and driving fees is still a concern for some households.",
    "accessibility": "Logan Square has a diverse mode of transportation usage with 26.5% using transit and 36.6% driving alone. The community has a significant number of households without a vehicle (21.2%), indicating a reliance on public transit. Accessibility improvements in transit could benefit a large portion of the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on transit and the significant number of households without vehicles, improving transit accessibility and reducing travel time is crucial. However, the community's relatively high income allows for some flexibility in accepting higher taxes or fees if it results in better services. The focus is on balancing lower fares and reasonable taxes to enhance transit services while considering the impact on lower-income residents. Proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized to ensure affordability and improved transit times."
