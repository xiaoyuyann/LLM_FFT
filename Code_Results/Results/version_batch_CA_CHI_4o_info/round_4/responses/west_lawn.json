    "disposable_income": "The median income in West Lawn is $69,647, with a per capita income of $25,786. A significant portion of the population earns between $25,000 and $149,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as higher fares or driver fees, which could impact their discretionary spending on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (63.4%) or carpool (18.0%) to work, with only 9.8% using transit. This suggests that while transit improvements could benefit some, policies that significantly increase driving costs might disproportionately affect the majority who rely on cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on driving and moderate income levels, policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with minimal tax increases are preferred. This approach aims to improve transit without significantly burdening drivers or reducing disposable income. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing travel time and costs for both drivers and transit users, while considering the community's income sensitivity and current transportation habits."
