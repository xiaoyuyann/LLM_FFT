    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a median income of $68,091 and a per capita income of $32,132. The income distribution shows a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000, which suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income range, a substantial portion of the community may have limited discretionary spending. Policies that increase costs significantly could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The community has a high percentage of residents who drive alone (59.2%) and a smaller percentage using transit (12.5%). This indicates a reliance on cars, but also a need to improve transit to make it a more viable option for more residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the income distribution and current transportation usage, policies that balance affordability with improved transit services are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this can benefit both transit users and drivers by reducing congestion. The top-ranked policies reflect a balance between cost and improved service, aiming to make transit more attractive while considering the financial impact on residents."
