    "disposable_income": "The median household income in East Side is $61,898, with a significant portion of households earning between $25,000 and $74,999. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with some households potentially sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may prioritize affordability in transportation to maintain their discretionary spending on other necessities and services.",
    "accessibility": "With 68.4% of residents driving alone and only 7.7% using transit, the community heavily relies on cars. However, the mean commute time is 36.4 minutes, indicating potential benefits from reduced travel times. Improving transit could attract more users if it becomes more efficient and affordable.",
    "decision_rationale": "The East Side community values affordability and efficiency in transportation. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden household budgets. The community's reliance on cars suggests that reducing driving times and costs is also important. Therefore, proposals that balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving are prioritized."
