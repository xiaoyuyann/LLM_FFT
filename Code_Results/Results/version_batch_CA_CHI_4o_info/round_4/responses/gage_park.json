    "disposable_income": "The median income in Gage Park is $50,112, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $19,524, residents have limited discretionary spending. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, are preferable to maintain current consumption levels.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on driving (59.6%) and transit (17.9%). Policies that improve transit times and reduce congestion without significantly increasing costs are beneficial. The community has a relatively high car ownership rate, but a notable percentage (20.5%) have no vehicle, emphasizing the need for affordable and efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the focus is on minimizing costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized to ensure affordability. Driver fees are considered to reduce congestion and improve transit times, but they should not be too high to avoid burdening drivers. The selected policies balance these factors, aiming to enhance transit service without imposing significant financial strain on residents."
