    "disposable_income": "The median income in New City is $40,959, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $21,622, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A large portion of the community relies on driving (53.7%) and transit (17.9%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (24.5%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Proposals with moderate driver fees are considered to encourage a shift to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The top-ranked proposals aim to improve transit times while keeping costs manageable for residents."
