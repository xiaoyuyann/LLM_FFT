    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on driving (57.2%) and transit (23.7%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (24% of households).",

Lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized to ensure affordability. Driver fees are considered to reduce congestion and improve transit times, benefiting both drivers and transit users.
