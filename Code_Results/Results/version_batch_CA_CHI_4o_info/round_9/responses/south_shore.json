    "disposable_income": "The median income in South Shore is $39,649, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 33% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "A high percentage of residents (32.8%) use transit, and 37.8% of households do not own a vehicle. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate taxes are prioritized. The goal is to enhance transit service without significantly increasing costs for residents. Lower driving fees are less critical due to the lower car ownership and high transit usage. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes, which also improve transit times, are preferred."
