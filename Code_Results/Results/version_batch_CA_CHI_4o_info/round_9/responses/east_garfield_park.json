    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park has a median income of $31,762 and a per capita income of $20,343. A significant portion of the population (43.7%) earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of the population earning below $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact the community's ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "40% of households do not own a vehicle, and 25% of the population uses transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community. The mean commute time is 35.1 minutes, suggesting a need for efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to enhance affordability and accessibility. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The community benefits from reduced car travel times and improved transit efficiency, but affordability remains a key concern. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower fares and moderate fees are ranked higher."
