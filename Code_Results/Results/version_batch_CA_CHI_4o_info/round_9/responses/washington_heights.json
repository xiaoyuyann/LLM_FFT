    "disposable_income": "The median income in Washington Heights is $66,797, with a per capita income of $29,673. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a substantial portion of the population earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "58.2% of residents drive alone, while 22.3% use transit. Car ownership is relatively high, with 83.2% of households owning at least one vehicle. However, 16.8% of households have no vehicle, relying on transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial strain while encouraging transit use. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit service, as it supports those without vehicles. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between affordability and improved transit efficiency, considering the community's economic constraints and transportation needs."
