    "disposable_income": "The majority of households in Fuller Park have an income of less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income. This suggests that any increase in costs, whether through transit fares, sales taxes, or driving fees, could significantly impact residents' financial situations.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 70% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely minimal. Residents may prioritize essential goods and services, making them sensitive to any policy that increases their cost of living.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on driving (49.3%) and transit (18.7%) for commuting. However, 58% of households do not own a vehicle, indicating a reliance on public transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low income levels and high reliance on public transit, policies that minimize costs while improving transit services are prioritized. A lower transit fare and driving fee, combined with a moderate sales tax, would be ideal to enhance transit services without overly burdening residents financially. The selected policies aim to balance improved transit times and costs, considering the community's limited disposable income and reliance on public transportation."
