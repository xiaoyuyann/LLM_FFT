    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a median income of $72,159 and a per capita income of $38,718. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, which suggests that affordability is a key concern for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a notable portion of the community may be sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these could impact their ability to spend on other necessities and discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "Bridgeport has a relatively high percentage of residents who drive alone (48.3%) and a significant portion who use transit (16%). The community also has a notable percentage of households without a vehicle (17.8%), indicating a reliance on public transit for some residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the income distribution and transportation mode preferences, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The top-ranked proposals should aim to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users, while not overly burdening lower-income residents with high taxes or fees."
