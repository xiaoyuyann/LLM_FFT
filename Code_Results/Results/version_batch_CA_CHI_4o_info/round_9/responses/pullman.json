    "disposable_income": "The median income in Pullman is $54,755, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $50,000. This suggests that disposable income is limited for many residents, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $32,327, residents may prioritize essential spending over discretionary consumption. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens, such as lower fares and taxes, would be preferable.",
    "accessibility": "A significant portion of the community relies on driving (64%) and transit (17.6%) for commuting. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility, especially for those without vehicles (16.1%).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance affordability with improved transit services are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to minimize financial strain while enhancing transit efficiency. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between reducing travel times and maintaining low costs, considering both transit users and drivers."
