    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen has a high median income of $139,046 and a per capita income of $70,693, indicating a relatively high level of disposable income. A significant portion of households earn $150,000 and over, suggesting that the community can absorb moderate increases in taxes or fees without significant financial strain.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. However, they may still be sensitive to changes in costs that could affect their lifestyle, such as increased transit fares or driving fees.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (57.9%), with a smaller percentage using transit (10.5%). This suggests that while transit improvements could benefit some, policies that maintain or improve driving conditions are also important. The community has a high rate of car ownership, with 44.1% owning two vehicles and 18.2% owning three or more.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high income and car ownership, policies that slightly increase costs but significantly improve transit times and reduce driving times are favorable. A moderate sales tax increase is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as the community can afford it. Reducing driving time is also crucial due to the high percentage of residents who drive alone. Therefore, proposals that balance these factors by improving transit and driving conditions while keeping costs reasonable are prioritized."
