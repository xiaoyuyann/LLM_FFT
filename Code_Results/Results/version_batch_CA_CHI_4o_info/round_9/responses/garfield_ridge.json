    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge has a relatively high median income of $90,374 and a per capita income of $37,983. A significant portion of households earn over $100,000, indicating a good level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning over $100,000, residents likely have a moderate to high level of discretionary spending. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, which suggests some sensitivity to increased costs.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (71.2%), with only 7.6% using transit. Car ownership is high, with 58.8% of households owning two or more vehicles. This suggests that accessibility is more car-dependent, and improvements in transit might not immediately benefit the majority.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and costs are prioritized. However, improving transit is also important to provide alternatives and reduce congestion. A balance between low transit fares and moderate driver fees is ideal to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending, especially for lower-income households. Therefore, proposals with moderate driver fees, lower transit fares, and lower sales taxes are prioritized."
