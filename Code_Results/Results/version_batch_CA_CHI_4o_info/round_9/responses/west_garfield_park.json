    "disposable_income": "West Garfield Park has a median income of $36,360 and a per capita income of $18,503, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies crucial.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 42.2% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens, such as low fares and taxes, are preferable.",
    "accessibility": "38.7% of households have no vehicle, and 27.9% of residents use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is essential, as a significant portion of the community relies on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's low income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are prioritized to enhance affordability and accessibility. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit services and reduce congestion, are favored. The selected policies balance cost, accessibility, and service improvement."
