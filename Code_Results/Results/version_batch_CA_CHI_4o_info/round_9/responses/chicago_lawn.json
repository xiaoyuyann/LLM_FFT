    "disposable_income": "The median income in Chicago Lawn is $43,293, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $20,907, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A large portion of the community relies on driving (57.8%) and carpooling (20.6%), with only 14.9% using transit. Policies that improve transit times and reduce costs could encourage more transit use, but must balance with the community's reliance on driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income constraints and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that reduce transit fares and driving times while maintaining a reasonable tax rate are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can improve transit accessibility without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it doesn't overly impact discretionary spending."
