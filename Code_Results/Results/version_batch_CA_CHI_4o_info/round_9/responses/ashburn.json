    "disposable_income": "The median income in Ashburn is $78,060, with a per capita income of $28,910. A significant portion of the population earns between $50,000 and $149,999, indicating a moderate level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transit fares and driver fees. The community's spending on goods and services could be impacted by higher taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "67.6% of residents drive alone, while 11.4% use transit. Car ownership is high, with 92.3% of households owning at least one vehicle. This suggests that while transit improvements are beneficial, car travel is predominant.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and predominant use of driving, policies that reduce driving time and costs are favorable. However, improving transit is also important for the 11.4% who rely on it. Balancing lower fares and moderate taxes with reduced driving times is key. Proposals with a $0.75 fare and moderate driver fees are prioritized to maintain affordability while improving transit times. A 1% tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as it aligns with the current tax rate and supports better services."
