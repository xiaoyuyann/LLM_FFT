    "disposable_income": "The median income in Auburn Gresham is $41,000, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $23,557, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Auburn Gresham has a high percentage of residents who drive alone (57.5%) and a notable portion using transit (21.1%). Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Proposals with moderate driver fees are considered to encourage a shift to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The top-ranked proposals offer a combination of reduced travel times and affordable costs, aligning with the community's economic constraints and transportation needs."
