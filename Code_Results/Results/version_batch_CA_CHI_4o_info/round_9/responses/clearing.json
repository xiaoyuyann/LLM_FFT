    "disposable_income": "The median household income in Clearing is $73,778, with a significant portion of households earning between $50,000 and $149,999. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with some capacity to absorb additional costs from taxes or fees, but with a need to be mindful of the impact on lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $33,089, residents have some discretionary spending power. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating that increases in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (74.1%) drive alone, indicating a high reliance on personal vehicles. Only 6.9% use transit, suggesting that improvements in transit could benefit a small but significant portion of the population. The mean commute time is 31.9 minutes, which is relatively high, indicating potential benefits from reduced travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on driving, policies that reduce car travel time and cost are prioritized. However, improving transit is also important for the minority who rely on it. Balancing lower fares and fees with moderate tax increases can enhance transit services without overly burdening residents. The top choices aim to reduce car travel time while keeping transit affordable and improving service quality. A moderate sales tax increase is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times and services, benefiting the community's overall accessibility."
