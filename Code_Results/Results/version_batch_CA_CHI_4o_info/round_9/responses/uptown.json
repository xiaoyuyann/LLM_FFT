    "disposable_income": "Uptown has a median income of $66,871 and a per capita income of $49,783. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a diverse income distribution, a substantial portion of the community may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, which could impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Uptown has a high percentage of residents using transit (34.9%) and a significant number without vehicles (42.1%). This suggests a strong reliance on public transportation, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high reliance on public transit and the income distribution, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to maintain affordability and improve transit efficiency. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services, as many residents depend on public transportation. The goal is to balance cost with improved transit times and accessibility."
