    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a median income of $57,591 and a per capita income of $36,162. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 44.8% of households earning less than $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Residents may prioritize essential expenses over additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Rogers Park has a high percentage of residents using transit (28.1%) and a significant portion without vehicles (37.2%). This suggests a reliance on public transportation and the need for affordable and efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on public transit and limited disposable income, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Proposals with a balance of lower fares, moderate taxes, and reasonable driving fees are preferred to enhance transit accessibility while considering the financial constraints of residents."
