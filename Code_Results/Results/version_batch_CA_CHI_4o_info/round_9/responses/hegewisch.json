    "disposable_income": "The median income in Hegewisch is $58,647, with a per capita income of $31,457. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.6% of households earning less than $25,000, there is limited discretionary income. Therefore, policies that minimize additional costs, such as lower fares and taxes, are preferable to ensure residents can maintain their current consumption levels.",
    "accessibility": "65.2% of residents drive alone, while only 10.8% use transit. Improving transit times and affordability could encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. However, the community's high car ownership suggests that driving remains a critical mode of transport.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income distribution and reliance on driving, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can enhance transit appeal without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden low-income households. The selected policies aim to improve transit efficiency and affordability while considering the community's economic constraints and transportation habits."
