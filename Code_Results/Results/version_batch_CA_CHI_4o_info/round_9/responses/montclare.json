    "disposable_income": "The median income in Montclare is $69,038, with a per capita income of $33,574. A significant portion of the population earns less than $50,000, indicating a need to consider affordability in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 20.3% of households earning less than $25,000, affordability is crucial. The community's spending on transportation should not significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Montclare has a high rate of car ownership, with 74.9% driving alone to work. Only 4.4% use transit, suggesting that improvements in transit could benefit the community by providing more options and potentially reducing congestion.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and reliance on driving, policies that reduce driving time and costs are favorable. However, improving transit options is also important to provide alternatives and reduce congestion. Balancing lower fares and moderate taxes with reasonable driving fees can enhance transit services without overly burdening residents financially. The selected policies aim to improve transit times and maintain affordability, considering the community's income distribution and current transportation habits."
