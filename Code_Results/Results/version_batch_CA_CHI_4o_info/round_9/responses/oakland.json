    "disposable_income": "The median income in Oakland is $27,693, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferred.",
    "accessibility": "41.7% of households have no vehicle, and 19.9% use transit. Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial, as a significant portion of the community relies on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The community's high percentage of households without vehicles suggests that transit improvements will have a broad impact. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit services without excessive cost increases, are favored."
