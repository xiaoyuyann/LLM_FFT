    "disposable_income": "The median income in Austin is $40,086, with a significant portion of the population earning less than $25,000. This indicates limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $23,403, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Austin has a high percentage of residents without vehicles (30.6%) and a significant reliance on public transit (23.7%). Improving transit accessibility and affordability is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and high reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized. A lower sales tax is also preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary consumption. The goal is to enhance transit accessibility while keeping costs manageable for residents. Policies that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are also considered to improve overall accessibility."
