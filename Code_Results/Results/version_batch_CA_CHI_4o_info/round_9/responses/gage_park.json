    "disposable_income": "The median income in Gage Park is $50,112, with a significant portion of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $19,524, residents have limited discretionary spending. High transit fares or driver fees could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "59.6% of residents drive alone, while 17.9% use transit. A significant portion of the community relies on cars, but improving transit could benefit those without vehicles (20.5% of households).",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's income constraints, lower fares and fees are prioritized to minimize financial burden. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, benefiting the 17.9% who use transit and potentially encouraging more to switch from driving. Reducing car travel time is also important, as a majority drive alone. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and moderate fees that improve transit times and reduce car travel times are preferred."
