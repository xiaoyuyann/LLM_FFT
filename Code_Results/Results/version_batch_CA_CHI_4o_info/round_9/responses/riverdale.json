    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has a median income of $41,144 and a per capita income of $19,721. A significant portion of the population earns less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large percentage of households earning below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "A majority of residents drive alone (67.9%), but a notable portion (12.9%) relies on transit. Improving transit times could benefit those without vehicles and reduce overall commute times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, policies with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize financial strain. However, improving transit times is also crucial for accessibility. Balancing these factors, the chosen policies aim to reduce costs while enhancing transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting both drivers and transit users."
