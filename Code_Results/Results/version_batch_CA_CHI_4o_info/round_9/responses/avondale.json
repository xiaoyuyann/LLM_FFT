    "disposable_income": "Avondale has a diverse income distribution with a significant portion of households earning above $100,000, indicating a relatively high disposable income for many residents. However, there is also a notable percentage of households earning less than $50,000, suggesting income disparity.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a substantial portion of the population earning above $100,000, discretionary consumption is likely robust for many households. However, the presence of lower-income households means that affordability of transportation options remains important.",
    "accessibility": "Avondale has a mix of transportation modes with nearly half of the population driving alone and a significant portion using transit. The community's accessibility to resources and services is supported by both driving and transit options, but improvements in transit could benefit those without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the income diversity, it's important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to support lower-income residents while still enhancing transit. Proposals with higher driver fees are considered to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting the community's overall accessibility. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times and improve transit affordability while considering the impact of taxes on discretionary spending."
