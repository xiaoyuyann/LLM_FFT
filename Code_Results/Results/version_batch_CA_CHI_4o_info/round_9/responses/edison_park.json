    "disposable_income": "Edison Park has a relatively high median income of $120,024 and a per capita income of $57,872. A significant portion of the population earns over $100,000, indicating a strong disposable income base.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high income level, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. However, a notable portion of the population earns less than $50,000, so affordability of transit and driving fees is still a consideration.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents drive alone (69.1%), with only 8.4% using transit. Car ownership is high, with 61% owning two or more vehicles. This suggests that while transit improvements are beneficial, driving remains the primary mode of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high car ownership and preference for driving, policies that reduce driving time and cost are prioritized. However, improving transit is also important to provide alternatives and reduce congestion. A balance between low transit fares and moderate driver fees is ideal to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, coupled with lower sales taxes, are prioritized."
