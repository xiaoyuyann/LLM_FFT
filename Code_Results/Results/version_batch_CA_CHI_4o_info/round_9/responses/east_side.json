    "disposable_income": "The median household income in East Side is $61,898, with a significant portion of households earning between $25,000 and $49,999. This suggests a moderate level of disposable income, with some households potentially sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $25,646, residents may have limited discretionary spending. A higher sales tax or increased transit fares could impact their ability to spend on other necessities or leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The majority of residents (68.4%) drive alone, indicating a reliance on personal vehicles. Only 7.7% use transit, suggesting that improvements in transit could benefit a smaller portion of the community. The mean commute time is 36.4 minutes, which is relatively high, indicating potential benefits from reduced travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on driving and moderate income levels, proposals that balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees with minimal tax increases are preferred. Reducing travel times for both driving and transit is important, but the community's reliance on cars suggests that driver fees should not be too high. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could encourage more residents to switch to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
