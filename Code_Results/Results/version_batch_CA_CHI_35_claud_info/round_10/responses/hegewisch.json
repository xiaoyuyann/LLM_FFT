    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch has a median income of $58,647, with 45.6% households earning less than $50,000. The community has moderate disposable income, making residents sensitive to cost increases in transportation and sales tax",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.4, discretionary spending is limited for many residents. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially for the 27.6% earning less than $25,000",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars (65.2% drive alone) with only 10.8% using transit. 87.4% of households have at least one vehicle, indicating car-dependency. Transit improvements could benefit the 12.6% of households without vehicles",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Balance driver fees to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent majority. 3. Moderate transit fares to maintain affordability for lower-income residents. 4. Consider proposals that reduce both car and transit travel times. 5. Focus on proposals that don't excessively increase combined transportation costs given the income distribution"
