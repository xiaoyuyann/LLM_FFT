    "disposable_income": "Douglas has relatively low disposable income with median household income of $43,528 and 54.3% of households making less than $50k annually. This suggests high sensitivity to costs from fares, fees, and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households and per capita income of $35,007, discretionary spending is limited. Additional transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "44.4% of households have no vehicle, and 26.4% use transit for commuting. The community heavily relies on public transit, while 40.3% drive alone. Current mean commute time is 31.8 minutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize low transit fares and taxes to maintain affordability. 2. High transit dependency means better transit service is important. 3. Large car-free population benefits from improved transit times. 4. Some driving fee acceptable to fund transit improvements since 45.7% own cars. 5. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden leads to moderate policy combinations."
