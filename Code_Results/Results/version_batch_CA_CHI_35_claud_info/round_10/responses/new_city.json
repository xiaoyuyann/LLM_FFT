    "disposable_income": "New City has relatively low income levels with median income of $40,959 and 57.8% of households making less than $50,000. About one-third of households make less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes and transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets, particularly for lower-income families who make up a large portion of the population",
    "accessibility": "24.5% of households have no vehicle, and 41.3% have only one vehicle. 17.9% use transit for commuting, while 53.7% drive alone. The community needs balanced access to both transit and driving options, but cost sensitivity is high",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 2. Favor moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable for the quarter of households without cars. 3. Consider moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts given the mixed-mode usage. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to support transit-dependent populations"
