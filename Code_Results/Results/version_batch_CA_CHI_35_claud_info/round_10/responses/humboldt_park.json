    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $51,105 and per capita income is $25,358, with 49% of households earning less than $50k annually. This indicates limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially considering 25% of households earn less than $25k annually.",
    "accessibility": "20.1% use transit for work commutes, 25% have no vehicle, and 40.8% have one vehicle. Mean commute time is 35.7 minutes. The community needs affordable and efficient transit options while balancing costs for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Keep sales tax moderate to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden. 5. Consider policies that reduce travel times for both transit and cars."
