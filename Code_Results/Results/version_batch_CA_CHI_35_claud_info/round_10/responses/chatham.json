    "disposable_income": "Chatham has relatively low income levels with median household income of $39,348 and 58.7% of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests high sensitivity to costs from fares, fees, and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower income levels and high percentage of households below $50,000, residents likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Additional transportation costs would significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "31.8% of households have no vehicle, and 27.3% rely on transit for commuting. Mean commute time is 37.9 minutes, suggesting significant dependence on public transportation. Good transit service is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares ($0.75) given income constraints and high transit dependency. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to preserve purchasing power. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to fund transit while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance between transit service improvements and cost burden. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs affordable."
