    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a relatively wealthy area with 61.3% of households earning over $100,000 annually. However, there's income diversity with about 20% earning under $50,000. This suggests most residents can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high income levels, residents likely have significant discretionary spending. The 1-1.5% sales tax impact would be notable given higher consumption levels, but manageable for most residents.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit access and walkability, with only 22.7% using cars as primary transport. 50.5% of households don't own vehicles, and 47.9% primarily walk/bike/use transit. The Loop is a transit-rich environment with multiple L lines and bus routes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that improve transit times given high transit usage. 2. Higher driving fees acceptable since few residents drive regularly. 3. Moderate fare increases acceptable given income levels. 4. Balance improved service with tax burden. 5. Selected policies that reduce car travel times to benefit business district access. Ranked proposals that combine moderate-to-high driving fees (to fund transit) with moderate fares and taxes, optimizing transit times without excessive cost burden."
