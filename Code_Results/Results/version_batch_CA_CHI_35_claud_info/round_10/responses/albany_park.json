    "disposable_income": "Mixed-income community with 31.3% earning under $50k, 29.3% middle income ($50k-$100k), and 39.3% earning over $100k. This suggests varying levels of sensitivity to transit costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, about one-third of residents may be price-sensitive to both transit fares and sales tax increases. Higher-income households (39.3%) have more flexibility to absorb increased costs",
    "accessibility": "Good mix of transportation options with 23.7% using transit and 45.5% driving alone. 19.1% have no vehicle, indicating strong transit dependency. The community needs balanced policies that serve both transit users and drivers",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals that maintain affordable transit access for lower-income residents (31.3% under $50k) while improving service. 2. Consider moderate driving fees to reduce congestion given 45.5% drive alone. 3. Balance tax burden given mixed income levels. 4. Favor policies that reduce transit travel time for the 23.7% transit users. 5. Selected policies that maintain reasonable costs for both modes while improving service quality"
