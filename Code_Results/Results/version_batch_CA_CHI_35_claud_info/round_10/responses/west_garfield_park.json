    "disposable_income": "The community has relatively low income levels with 42.2% households earning less than $25,000 and median income of $36,360. This suggests high sensitivity to any additional transportation costs or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($18,503) and high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Additional transportation costs would significantly impact other essential spending.",
    "accessibility": "38.7% of households have no vehicle available, and 27.9% rely on transit for commuting. The mean commute time is 36.1 minutes, suggesting significant dependence on public transportation despite longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and taxes. 2. Consider high transit dependency requires maintaining service quality. 3. Lower driving fees are less critical since many residents don't own cars. 4. Balance between service improvements and cost burden. 5. Selected proposals 0, 9, 3, 18, 1 because they combine low transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) with moderate taxes (0.5-1.5%) and minimal driving fees, protecting low-income transit users while maintaining service levels."
