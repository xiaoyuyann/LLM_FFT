    "disposable_income": "West Town is a relatively affluent area with median income of $128,717 and 59.2% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can absorb moderate increases in transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($82,088), residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would affect this but wouldn't be severely burdensome given the income levels",
    "accessibility": "The area has diverse transportation usage: 35.1% drive alone, 23.2% use transit, and 8.8% walk/bike. 75.2% of households have at least one vehicle, while 20.2% have no vehicle. Good mix of transit and driving accessibility needed",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized balanced policies that improve both transit and driving times without excessive costs given the mixed transportation needs. 2. Community can handle moderate fare/fee increases given high incomes. 3. Moderate tax rates preferred as residents have high discretionary spending. 4. Policies that significantly reduce transit times valued due to 23.2% transit usage. 5. Selected options that reduce driving times but don't overly penalize drivers given 35.1% drive-alone rate"
