    "disposable_income": "Archer Heights has a mixed income profile with 46.3% households earning less than $50,000 annually, indicating significant budget constraints for many residents. About 29.5% earn over $100,000, suggesting some economic diversity",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high percentage of lower-middle income households, many residents would be sensitive to increased transportation costs and sales taxes. The average household size of 3.1 suggests multiple dependents and careful budgeting of discretionary spending",
    "accessibility": "76.4% of households own at least one vehicle, with drive alone (58.7%) and carpooling (19.4%) being dominant commute modes. Transit usage is moderate at 13.1%, while 23.7% have no vehicle access, indicating need for reliable transit options",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending for lower-income families. 2. Balance moderate transit fares ($1.25) to maintain service quality while remaining affordable. 3. Support modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening the majority who drive. 4. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel time to benefit car-free households. 5. Avoid highest combined costs given the community's income profile"
