    "disposable_income": "The community has relatively low income levels with 58.6% of households earning less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $39,908. This suggests high sensitivity to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low income levels and high percentage of households below poverty line, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "36.5% of households have no vehicle, and 29.5% rely on transit for commuting. Combined with 46.8% having just one vehicle, the community heavily depends on both public transit and car access.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) given high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households. 3. Selected lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost considerations. 5. Considered high proportion of both transit users and single-car households."
