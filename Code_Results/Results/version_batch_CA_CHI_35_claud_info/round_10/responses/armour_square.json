    "disposable_income": "Armour Square has a significant low-income population with 50.8% households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests limited disposable income and high sensitivity to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely limited. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "33.9% of households have no vehicle, and 24.4% use transit for commuting. The area has high transit dependency, with significant Asian population (71.7%) and lower-income residents relying on public transportation",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low-income population. 2. Prefer lower sales tax rates to protect discretionary spending power. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening the 41.1% who drive alone. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on residents. 5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs affordable"
