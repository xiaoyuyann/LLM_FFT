    "disposable_income": "Lake View is a relatively affluent area with median income of $100,625 and 50.2% of households making over $100,000. This suggests residents have higher disposable income and can better absorb transportation costs compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($87,044), residents likely have significant discretionary spending. However, the high cost of living in Lake View means transportation costs still impact overall household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit access with 36.9% using transit for commuting. 39.6% of households don't own cars, and 46.6% have just one vehicle, indicating strong transit dependency. The high percentage of work-from-home (27.9%) suggests flexibility in transportation needs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high transit usage and car-free households, prioritize policies that improve transit service while keeping fares moderate. 2. Higher tax rates are acceptable given income levels to fund better transit. 3. Support driving fees to reduce congestion and fund transit improvements. 4. Balance between transit time improvements and cost increases. 5. Consider the large work-from-home population that may make fewer regular trips."
