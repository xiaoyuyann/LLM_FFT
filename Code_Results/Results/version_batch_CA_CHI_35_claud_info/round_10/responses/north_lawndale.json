    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale is a low-income community with 63% of households making less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $33,334. This suggests residents are particularly sensitive to cost increases from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, as would increased transit fares or driving fees.",
    "accessibility": "36.5% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% rely on transit for commuting. While 57.3% drive alone, the high no-vehicle rate suggests transit accessibility is crucial. The community needs affordable transit options while maintaining reasonable driving costs for working families.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) given high transit dependency and low incomes. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected policies that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs affordable for both transit users and drivers."
