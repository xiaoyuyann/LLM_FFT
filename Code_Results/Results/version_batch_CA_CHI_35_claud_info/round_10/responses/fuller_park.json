    "disposable_income": "Fuller Park is a low-income community with 70% of households earning less than $25,000 annually, making residents highly sensitive to any cost increases in transportation or taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, making them vulnerable to any additional transportation costs or sales tax increases",
    "accessibility": "58% of households have no vehicle, making transit accessibility crucial. Currently 18.7% use transit and 49.3% drive alone, while 22.6% carpool, suggesting a mix of transportation needs but high transit dependency",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) due to low income levels. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without excessive burden. 4. Balance between transit time improvements and cost impacts. 5. Consider high carpool usage suggesting some driving necessity. Selected proposals that minimize costs while maintaining service quality for transit-dependent population"
