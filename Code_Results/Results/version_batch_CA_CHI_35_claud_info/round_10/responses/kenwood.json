    "disposable_income": "Kenwood shows significant income diversity with 45% making under $50K and 33.2% making over $100K. Median income is $58,052, suggesting moderate disposable income but with many residents sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and household sizes, many residents have limited discretionary spending power. Higher taxes and fees would impact the 45% lower-income households significantly more than affluent residents",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transportation needs - 33.1% have no vehicle, 50.3% have one vehicle. Transit usage is significant at 23.1%, while 40.1% drive alone. Good balance of transit and driving infrastructure needed",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending power of lower-income residents. 2. Favored moderate transit fares ($1.25) to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable for the 33.1% car-less households. 3. Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening the 40.1% who drive to work. 4. Balanced travel time improvements for both transit and driving given the mixed-mode usage. 5. Considered impact on the significant portion (27.4%) making under $25,000"
