    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has relatively low income levels with median income of $41,144 and 58.2% of households making less than $50,000. About 33.8% make less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes and transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets and reduce spending on other essential needs",
    "accessibility": "19.4% of households have no vehicle, and 12.9% rely on transit for commuting. Mean commute time is 33.8 minutes. The community needs affordable and efficient transit options while keeping costs manageable for the majority who drive (67.9% drive alone)",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to preserve purchasing power. 2. Keep transit fares low ($0.75-$1.25) to help transit-dependent residents. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) can help improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on low-income residents. 5. Avoid highest tax/fee combinations that would strain limited household budgets"
