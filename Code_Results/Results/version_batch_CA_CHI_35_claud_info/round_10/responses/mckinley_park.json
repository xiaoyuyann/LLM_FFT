    "disposable_income": "McKinley Park has a median household income of $70,411, with about 36.4% of households earning less than $50,000. The per capita income of $32,106 suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents somewhat sensitive to transportation costs",

Considered the moderate income levels and need to maintain affordability. 3. Selected policies that improve transit service while keeping fares reasonable. 4. Chose options with moderate sales tax to maintain service quality without excessive burden. 5. Included some driving fees to reduce congestion while keeping costs manageable for the majority who drive"
