    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class community with median income of $50,112 and per capita income of $19,524. About 50% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of lower-income households and large average household size (3.4), discretionary spending is likely constrained. Higher taxes and fees would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "20.5% of households have no vehicle, while 17.9% use transit for commuting. 59.6% drive alone and 14.7% carpool, showing mixed reliance on both transit and cars. Good transportation access is crucial for this working community",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents and lower-income households. 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) to balance transit funding with household budget impacts. 3. Consider moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Focus on options that reduce transit travel times to support working commuters. 5. Balance overall costs with service improvements given limited household disposable income"
