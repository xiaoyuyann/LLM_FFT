    "disposable_income": "West Lawn has a median household income of $69,647, with about 37% of households earning less than $50,000. The per capita income of $25,786 suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents somewhat sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of households in middle-income brackets and large average household size of 3.4, discretionary spending capacity is moderate. Higher taxes and fees would impact household budgets meaningfully",
    "accessibility": "The community heavily relies on cars with 87.7% of households having at least one vehicle. 63.4% drive alone to work, while only 9.8% use transit. This suggests good road access but limited transit dependency",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, prefer policies with lower driving fees to avoid burdening majority of residents. 2. Lower sales tax preferred due to impact on household budgets. 3. Moderate transit fares acceptable since fewer residents rely on transit. 4. Balance between maintaining reasonable car travel times and not overly burdening drivers with fees. 5. Consider policies that don't drastically increase costs while still improving travel times"
