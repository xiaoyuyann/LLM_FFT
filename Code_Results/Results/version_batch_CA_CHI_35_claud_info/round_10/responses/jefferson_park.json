    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park has a relatively high median household income of $90,740, with 44.1% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher income levels, residents have significant discretionary spending power. However, about 27% earn under $50,000, so policy impacts on lower-income households must be considered.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transportation options with 90.2% of households having at least one vehicle and 13.4% using transit. The high car ownership (48.6% having 2+ vehicles) suggests strong preference for driving, while transit usage indicates the importance of maintaining transit service.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies that balance driving convenience with moderate fees since 61.7% drive alone. 2. Considered moderate tax rates to maintain transit service without overly burdening discretionary spending. 3. Favored proposals with lower transit fares to support the 13.4% transit users and encourage more transit use. 4. Selected options that reduce car travel times to benefit the majority who drive. 5. Avoided highest tax/fee combinations given the significant middle-income population."
