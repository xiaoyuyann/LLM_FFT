    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a relatively low median income of $43,048, with 53.6% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to transportation costs and tax increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 35.5% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially for essential purchases.",
    "accessibility": "30.3% of households have no vehicle, and 21.4% use transit for commuting. The community has a significant transit-dependent population, making transit accessibility and affordability crucial. 49.3% drive alone, indicating a need to balance both transit and driving considerations.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) due to high proportion of low-income and transit-dependent residents. 2. Favor lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect limited discretionary income. 3. Consider moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Avoid highest tax/fee combinations due to income constraints."
