    "disposable_income": "Oakland has a relatively low median income of $27,693, with 47.2% of households earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income for most residents, making them particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary consumption is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact residents' already constrained budgets for essential needs.",
    "accessibility": "41.7% of households have no vehicle, and 40.4% have only one vehicle. Transit usage (19.9%) is significant, while 48.2% drive alone. The community needs affordable transit options while maintaining reasonable driving costs for those who depend on cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high percentage of transit-dependent residents and low incomes. 2. Prefer lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to protect limited discretionary income. 3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on residents. 5. Consider policies that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs affordable."
