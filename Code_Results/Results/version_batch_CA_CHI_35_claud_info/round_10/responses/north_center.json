    "disposable_income": "North Center is an affluent area with median income of $148,585 and 67.4% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high incomes, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would impact this spending, but the community can likely absorb these costs better than lower-income areas",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transportation options with 87.4% of households having at least one vehicle. 20% use transit and 38.6% drive alone to work, suggesting both modes are important. 29.2% work from home, reducing daily transportation needs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost savings. 2. Balance needs of both drivers (38.6%) and transit users (20%). 3. Higher taxes/fees are acceptable if they improve service. 4. Favor policies that reduce transit times since 20% use transit. 5. Consider that 29.2% WFH means less daily impact from fees. Selected policies that offer best time improvements while keeping costs moderate"
