    "disposable_income": "Roseland has relatively low income levels with median income of $49,808 and 50.1% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs and sales tax increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($24,754) and high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "25.9% of households have no vehicle, and 20.1% use transit for work commutes. Good transit service is essential. 53.9% drive alone, so driving costs also matter significantly.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents\n2. Favored lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) due to limited discretionary income\n3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers\n4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden\n5. Considered high transit usage (20.1%) and no-vehicle households (25.9%)"
