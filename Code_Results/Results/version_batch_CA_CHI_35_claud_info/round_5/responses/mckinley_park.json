    "disposable_income": "McKinley Park has a median household income of $70,411, with about 36.4% of households earning less than $50,000. The per capita income of $32,106 suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents somewhat sensitive to transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many households have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets, especially for the 36.4% lower-income households who spend a larger portion of their income on necessities",
    "accessibility": "The community shows diverse transportation usage: 51.5% drive alone, 21.7% use transit, and 12.7% carpool. 87.7% of households own at least one vehicle, but significant transit usage indicates good transit access. This suggests policies should balance both driving and transit improvements",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with moderate tax rates to balance revenue needs with household budget impacts. 2. Favored proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to support the significant transit-using population. 3. Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion while not overly burdening the majority who drive. 4. Selected policies that achieve meaningful travel time improvements for both transit and driving. 5. Considered the large working-class population's need for affordable transportation options"
