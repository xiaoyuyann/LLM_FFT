    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge has a relatively high median income of $90,374, with 46% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher income levels, residents have significant discretionary spending power. However, the community needs to balance transportation costs with other expenses, considering that about 30% of households earn less than $50,000.",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars, with 71.2% driving alone and 92.2% of households owning at least one vehicle. Only 7.6% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility or preference for driving. The high car ownership indicates good road infrastructure but potential congestion issues.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, prefer policies with lower driving fees but still improve transit\n2. Consider moderate tax rates to balance service improvements with cost burden\n3. Prefer policies that reduce car travel time due to high driving population\n4. Look for balanced fare options that won't burden transit-dependent residents\n5. Prioritize options that improve both transit and driving times while keeping costs reasonable for mixed-income population"
