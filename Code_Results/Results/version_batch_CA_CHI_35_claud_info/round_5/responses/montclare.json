    "disposable_income": "Montclare has a median income of $69,038, with about 38.3% of households making less than $50,000 annually. This suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents somewhat sensitive to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.9, many families likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher taxes and fees would impact their consumption ability, especially for the 38.3% lower-income households.",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars with 87.3% of households having at least one vehicle and 74.9% driving alone to work. Only 4.4% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility or convenience. Current transit times are significantly higher than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Given high car dependency, favored moderate driving fees to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 3. Selected proposals with moderate transit fares ($1.25) to balance transit service quality with affordability. 4. Considered travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transportation needs. 5. Aimed to maintain reasonable costs for both transit users and drivers given the community's income distribution."
