    "disposable_income": "Austin has relatively low income levels with a median household income of $40,086 and 57.6% of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests high sensitivity to costs from fares, fees, and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high poverty rates and low per capita income ($23,403), residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Additional transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "30.6% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% use transit for work commutes. Mean commute time is 37.1 minutes, indicating heavy reliance on and need for efficient public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) given low income levels and high transit dependency. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit the significant transit-dependent population."
