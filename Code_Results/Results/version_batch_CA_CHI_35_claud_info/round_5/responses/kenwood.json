    "disposable_income": "Kenwood shows significant income diversity with 45% making under $50K and 33.2% making over $100K. Median income is $58,052, suggesting moderate disposable income but with many residents sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and household sizes, many residents have limited discretionary spending power. Higher taxes and fees would impact the 45% lower-income households significantly more than affluent residents",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transportation needs - 33.1% have no vehicle, 50.3% have one vehicle. Transit usage is significant at 23.1%, while 40.1% drive alone. Good balance of transit and driving infrastructure needed",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help car-less households (33.1%) and current transit users (23.1%). 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) to maintain service quality without overburdening lower-income residents. 3. Include some driving fees to improve transit service and reduce congestion, but avoid highest fees. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel time from current 58.8 minutes"
