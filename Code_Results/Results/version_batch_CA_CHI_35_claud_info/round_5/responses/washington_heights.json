    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $66,797, with about 37.7% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests many residents have limited disposable income and would be sensitive to increased transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.7, many families likely have modest discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets significantly.",
    "accessibility": "22.3% use transit and 16.8% have no vehicle, indicating significant transit dependency. However, 58.2% drive alone, showing car is still primary mode. Good transit service is essential while keeping costs manageable for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents. 2. Moderate sales tax (1%) to balance revenue needs with household budgets. 3. Modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening majority who drive. 4. Avoid highest tax/fee combinations given income constraints. 5. Select options that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs reasonable."
