    "disposable_income": "Englewood has very limited disposable income with 46.5% households earning less than $25,000 and a median income of $27,792, which is significantly below Chicago's average. This makes residents highly sensitive to any cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, discretionary spending is minimal. Most income likely goes to essential needs. Any additional transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact already limited discretionary funds.",
    "accessibility": "44.6% of households have no vehicle, making transit accessibility crucial. 25.2% use transit for commuting, while 51% drive alone. The community needs affordable transit options while maintaining reasonable driving costs for those who depend on cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lowest transit fares ($0.75) given high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Balanced driving fees considering both car-owners and transit users - moderate fees help fund transit without excessive burden. 4. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs affordable. 5. Considered combined impact of all fees/taxes on household budgets."
