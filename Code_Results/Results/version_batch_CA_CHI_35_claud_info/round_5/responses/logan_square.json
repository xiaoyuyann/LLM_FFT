    "disposable_income": "Logan Square has a relatively high median income of $97,759 and per capita income of $62,532, with 48.9% of households earning over $100,000. However, there's income diversity with 24.5% earning under $50,000",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, most residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity. Higher-income households can better absorb increased transportation costs, while lower-income households (24.5%) would be more sensitive to fare and tax increases",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with 26.5% using public transit and 21.2% car-free households. However, 42% drive (alone or carpool), and 53.5% own one vehicle, suggesting a need to balance both transit and driving improvements",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized balanced proposals that improve both transit and driving times without excessive cost burden on lower-income residents. 2. Considered the high transit usage (26.5%) and car-free population (21.2%) needing affordable transit. 3. Accounted for significant driving population (42%) that would benefit from reduced congestion. 4. Selected proposals with moderate tax increases that wouldn't overly burden the 24.5% lower-income households. 5. Favored proposals that reduce transit times while keeping fares reasonable"
