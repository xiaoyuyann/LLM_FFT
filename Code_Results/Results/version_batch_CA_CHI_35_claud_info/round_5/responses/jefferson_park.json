    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park has a relatively high median household income of $90,740, with 44.1% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher incomes and an average household size of 2.5, residents likely have significant discretionary spending. However, about 27% earn under $50,000, so cost sensitivity varies across the community.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good car access (90.1% households have 1+ vehicles) and transit options (13.4% use transit). 61.7% drive alone to work, while 13.4% use transit, indicating strong preference for driving but meaningful transit usage.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized balanced proposals that maintain reasonable transit fares while introducing moderate driving fees to improve service without excessive burden on drivers. 2. Considered the high car ownership and driving preference while acknowledging significant transit usage. 3. Selected proposals with moderate tax rates given the area's income levels. 4. Favored options that reduce transit travel times to benefit existing transit users. 5. Chose proposals that offer meaningful travel time improvements without extreme cost increases."
