    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn has relatively low income levels with median income of $43,293 and 55.3% of households making less than $50,000. This suggests residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($20,907) and large household sizes (avg 3.0), discretionary spending is limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets given the high proportion of lower-income residents.",
    "accessibility": "24.3% of households have no vehicle, while 39.8% have one vehicle. Transit usage (14.9%) is moderate, with driving alone (57.8%) and carpooling (20.6%) being dominant modes. This suggests need for both affordable transit and driving options.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares and low sales tax due to limited disposable income. 2. Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service given significant transit-dependent population. 3. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on drivers since carpooling is common. 4. Avoid highest tax rates (1.5%) due to impact on discretionary spending. 5. Prefer options that reduce transit travel time to support transit-dependent residents."
