    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has relatively low income levels with median income of $41,144 and 58.2% of households making less than $50,000. About 33.8% make less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes and transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets and reduce spending on other essential needs",
    "accessibility": "19.4% of households have no vehicle, and 12.9% rely on transit for commuting. Mean commute time is 33.8 minutes. The community needs affordable and efficient transit options while keeping costs manageable for the majority who drive (75.9% drive alone or carpool)",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 2. Balance lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help transit-dependent residents. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Focus on options that reduce transit travel times to help both transit users and those who might switch from driving. 5. Consider proposals that maintain reasonable driving costs given high car dependency"
