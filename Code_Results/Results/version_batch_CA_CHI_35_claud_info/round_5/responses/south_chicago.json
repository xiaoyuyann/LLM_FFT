    "disposable_income": "South Chicago has relatively low income levels with median income of $43,936 and 55.6% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests high sensitivity to costs from fares, fees and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($22,912) and high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is limited. A 1% sales tax on $20,000 consumption would cost $200 annually, significantly impacting household budgets",
    "accessibility": "31.6% households have no vehicle, and 23.7% use transit for commuting. Combined with 58.2% who drive alone, the community needs balanced policies that keep both transit and driving affordable while improving service",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower taxes and fares given income constraints. 2. Consider high transit dependency while maintaining reasonable driving costs. 3. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time without excessive fees. 4. Balance between service improvements and cost burden. 5. Selected proposals 10, 1, 4, 13, and 19 as they offer improved transit times with moderate cost increases"
