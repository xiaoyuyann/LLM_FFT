    "disposable_income": "Auburn Gresham is a lower-income community with median income of $41,000 and 56.8% of households making less than $50,000. This suggests residents are particularly sensitive to cost increases from taxes, fares, and fees",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households and per capita income of $23,557, residents have limited discretionary spending. Additional transportation costs would significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities",
    "accessibility": "29.9% of households have no vehicle, and 21.1% rely on transit for commuting. While 57.5% drive alone, the high car-less population means policies need to balance both transit and driving needs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower taxes and fares given income constraints. 2. Favored policies that improve transit times without excessive cost burden. 3. Considered the significant transit-dependent population. 4. Selected proposals that balance driving fees to improve service while not overly burdening drivers. 5. Focused on options that reduce travel times for both modes without major cost increases"
