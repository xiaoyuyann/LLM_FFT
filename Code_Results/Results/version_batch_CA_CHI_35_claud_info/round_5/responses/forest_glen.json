    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is an affluent community with median household income of $139,046 and 63% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can absorb moderate increases in transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($70,693), residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would impact this but may be tolerable given the income levels",
    "accessibility": "Car-centric community with 95% of households owning cars and 68.1% using cars for commuting. Only 10.5% use transit, suggesting good road access but limited transit dependency. 17.2% work from home",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and usage, prioritize proposals that improve driving times while maintaining reasonable costs. 2. With high incomes, moderate fee increases are acceptable if they improve service. 3. Lower priority on transit improvements given low usage, but maintain reasonable fares for the 10.5% transit users. 4. Balance tax burden against service improvements, considering high discretionary spending. 5. Favor proposals with moderate rather than maximum tax/fee increases given the community's car-dependent nature"
