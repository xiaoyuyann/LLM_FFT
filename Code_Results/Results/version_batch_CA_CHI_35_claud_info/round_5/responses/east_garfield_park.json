    "disposable_income": "Very limited disposable income with median household income of $31,762, and 43.7% of households earning less than $25,000. This suggests high sensitivity to any cost increases from taxes, fares, or fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary consumption is likely minimal. Any additional transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets and reduce already limited discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "40% of households have no vehicle, and 25% use transit for commuting. Mean commute time is 35.1 minutes. High dependence on both public transit and driving (51% drive alone), suggesting need for balanced but affordable transportation options.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lowest combined cost burden (low tax, fare, and fees). 2. High transit usage requires maintaining service quality while keeping fares affordable. 3. Consider significant car-dependent population but avoid high driving fees due to income constraints. 4. Selected proposals 0, 9, 3, 18, 21 as they balance: a) Lower tax rates (0.5-1.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending b) Lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents c) No driving fees to avoid additional burden on car-dependent households d) Reasonable transit times (55-68 minutes) given current conditions."
