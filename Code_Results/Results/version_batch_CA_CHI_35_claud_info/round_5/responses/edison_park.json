    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is a relatively affluent community with median income of $120,024 and 59.4% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($57,872), residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would affect this spending, but impact would be manageable given the income levels.",
    "accessibility": "The community is heavily car-dependent with 93.5% of households owning at least one vehicle and 69.1% driving alone to work. Only 8.4% use transit, suggesting good road access but limited transit reliance.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and usage, prioritize proposals with lower driving fees and moderate transit improvements. 2. Community can handle moderate tax increases given high incomes. 3. Focus on proposals that reduce driving time without excessive cost burden. 4. Balance between maintaining driving affordability while funding transit improvements. 5. Consider that most residents drive but should maintain transit options for the 8.4% transit users."
