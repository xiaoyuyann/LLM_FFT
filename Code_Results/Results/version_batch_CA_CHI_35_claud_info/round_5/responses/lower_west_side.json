    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $69,810, with about 37.7% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests a significant portion of residents have limited disposable income and would be sensitive to increased transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.4, many families likely have modest discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would impact their purchasing power for essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has mixed transportation usage with 43.8% driving alone, 24.5% using transit, and 23.8% households without vehicles. Good transit access is crucial for many residents. Most households (49.1%) have one vehicle, suggesting they mix travel modes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable for the significant transit-dependent population. 3. Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements for both transit and car users given the mixed-mode usage. 5. Considered the large proportion of lower-income households who would be sensitive to cost increases."
