    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale is a low-income community with 63% of households making less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $33,334. This suggests very limited disposable income and high sensitivity to any additional transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, discretionary spending is likely minimal. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, as a larger portion of income goes to necessities. The 42.3% earning less than $25,000 are particularly vulnerable to any cost increases.",
    "accessibility": "36.5% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% rely on transit for commuting. While 57.3% drive alone, the high no-vehicle rate suggests transit accessibility is crucial. The community needs affordable transit options while maintaining reasonable driving costs for working households.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents\n2. Keep sales tax moderate (1%) to balance transit funding and household burden\n3. Implement moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without excessive burden on drivers\n4. Avoid highest tax/fee combinations that would strain low-income households\n5. Select options that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility"
