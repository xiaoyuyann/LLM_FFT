    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a mixed income profile with median income of $71,683. About 39.5% households earn less than $50,000, while 34.7% earn over $100,000. This suggests careful consideration of fare and tax impacts across income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With per capita income of $39,283, residents have moderate discretionary spending power. Higher sales taxes would impact all residents, particularly the 39.5% lower-income households who have less flexible budgets.",
    "accessibility": "64.9% drive alone and 9.5% use transit for commuting. 88.7% of households have at least one vehicle, showing high car dependency. However, transit access needs to be maintained for the 11.3% of households without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending power across all income levels. 2. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening the car-dependent majority. 3. Balanced transit fares ($1.25) to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable for lower-income and car-free households. 4. Considered travel time improvements - proposals that reduce both transit and driving times. 5. Avoided highest tax/fee combinations that would strain household budgets."
