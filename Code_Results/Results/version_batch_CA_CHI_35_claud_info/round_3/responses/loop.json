    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a relatively wealthy area with 61.3% of households earning over $100,000 annually. However, there's income diversity with about 20% earning under $50,000. This suggests most residents can absorb moderate transportation cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high income levels, residents likely have significant discretionary spending. The 1-1.5% sales tax impact would be notable given high local consumption, but manageable for most residents",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit access and walkability, with 50.5% of households having no vehicle. Only 22.7% drive to work, while 47.9% use transit or walk/bike. This suggests strong preference for and reliance on non-car transportation",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that improve transit times given high transit usage. 2. Higher driving fees acceptable since half have no cars and few drive. 3. Can accept moderate fare increases given income levels. 4. Balance improved service from higher taxes against impact on high local spending. 5. Selected policies that significantly reduce transit times while keeping fares moderate and implementing driving fees to fund improvements and reduce congestion"
