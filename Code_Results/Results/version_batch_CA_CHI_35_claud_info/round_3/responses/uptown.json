    "disposable_income": "Mixed income levels with 38.6% earning under $50k and 31% earning over $100k. Median income of $66,871 suggests moderate disposable income, but significant income disparity exists",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high percentage of lower-income households (23.2% under $25k) and moderate median income, many residents would be sensitive to increased taxes and fees. Higher-income residents have more flexibility with transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Strong transit usage (34.9% commute by transit) and high percentage of car-free households (42.1%). Good transit access with multiple L lines and bus routes. Only 32.5% drive alone to work",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to high transit dependency and lower-income population. 2. Moderate tax increase acceptable to maintain service quality. 3. Support driving fees to fund transit and reduce congestion. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on residents. 5. Consider high percentage of no-car households needing reliable transit"
