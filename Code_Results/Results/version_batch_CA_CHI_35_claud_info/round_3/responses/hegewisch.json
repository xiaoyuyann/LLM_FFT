    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch has a median income of $58,647, with 45.6% households earning less than $50,000. The community has moderate disposable income, making residents sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and cost of living in Chicago, many households have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets, especially for the 27.6% earning less than $25,000",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars (65.2% drive alone) with limited transit usage (10.8%). High car ownership (87.4% have at least one vehicle) suggests car-dependent infrastructure and lifestyle. Transit times are significantly longer than driving times",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Given high car dependency, avoid high driving fees. 3. Balance transit improvement with cost burden. 4. Consider moderate fare increases only if they significantly improve transit times. 5. Selected proposals that minimize total cost impact while improving both driving and transit times"
