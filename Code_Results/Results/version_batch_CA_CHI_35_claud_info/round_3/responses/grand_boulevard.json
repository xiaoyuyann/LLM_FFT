    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has relatively low income levels with 53.6% of households earning less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $43,048. This suggests high sensitivity to cost increases from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely limited. Additional transportation costs and sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets and consumption abilities.",
    "accessibility": "30.3% of households have no vehicle, and 21.4% use transit for commuting. The community has significant transit dependency while also having 49.3% drive-alone commuters, indicating need for both affordable transit and reasonable driving costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (fare + tax + fees). 2. Need balance between transit affordability for non-car owners and reasonable driving costs for car owners. 3. Favor proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) and moderate driving fees to improve transit service without excessive burden. 4. Prefer lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to preserve purchasing power. 5. Consider travel time improvements but prioritize affordability given income constraints."
