    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class community with median income of $50,112 and per capita income of $19,524. About 50% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of lower-income households and large average household size (3.4), discretionary spending is likely constrained. Higher taxes and fees would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "20.5% of households have no vehicle, while 17.9% use transit for commuting. 59.6% drive alone and 14.7% carpool, showing balanced need for both transit and driving options. Good transit access is crucial for no-car households",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents and large car-less population. 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) to maintain transit service quality without excessive burden. 3. Include some driving fees to improve transit times and reduce congestion, but avoid highest fees given many driving commuters. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on working families. 5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs manageable"
