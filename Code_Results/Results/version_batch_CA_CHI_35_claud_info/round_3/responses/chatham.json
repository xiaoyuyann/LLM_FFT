    "disposable_income": "Chatham has relatively low income levels with median income of $39,348 and 58.7% of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests high sensitivity to costs from fares, fees, and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low median income and high percentage of lower-income households, discretionary spending is likely limited. Additional transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "31.8% of households have no vehicle, and 27.3% use transit for commuting. Mean commute time is 37.9 minutes, indicating heavy reliance on public transportation and need for efficient transit service",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares ($0.75) given income constraints and high transit dependency. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to preserve purchasing power. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to fund transit while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance between transit time improvements and cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit times while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents"
