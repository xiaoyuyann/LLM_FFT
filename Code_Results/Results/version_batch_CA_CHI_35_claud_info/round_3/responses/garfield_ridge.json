    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge has a relatively high median income of $90,374, with 46% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher income levels, residents have significant discretionary spending power. However, the community needs to balance transportation costs with other expenses, considering that about 30% of households earn less than $50,000.",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars, with 92.2% of households owning at least one vehicle and 71.2% of residents driving alone to work. Only 7.6% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility or preference for driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, policies with lower driving fees are preferred. 2. Higher sales tax is acceptable due to higher income levels, which can support better transit infrastructure. 3. Moderate transit fares are preferred to balance accessibility for lower-income residents. 4. Focus on reducing car travel times since majority drive. 5. Consider policies that maintain reasonable transit times for the 7.6% transit users."
