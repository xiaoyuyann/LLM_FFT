    "disposable_income": "North Center is an affluent area with median income of $148,585 and 67.4% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high incomes, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would affect this but would be relatively manageable given the wealth level. Annual consumption is likely high, making sales tax impact notable but not burdensome",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transportation options with 87.4% of households having at least one vehicle and 20% using transit for commuting. 29.2% work from home, reducing daily transportation needs. The area is well-served by both driving and transit infrastructure",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost savings. 2. Support policies that improve both transit and driving times since area uses both modes significantly. 3. Can tolerate higher fees/taxes given income levels if they yield better service. 4. Consider work-from-home population that makes fewer trips. 5. Balance between transit improvements and driving efficiency since area has mixed mode usage"
