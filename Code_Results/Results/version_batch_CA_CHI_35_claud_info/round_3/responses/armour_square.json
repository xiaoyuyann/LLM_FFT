    "disposable_income": "Armour Square has relatively low income levels with 50.8% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests high sensitivity to cost increases from taxes, fares, and fees",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high percentage of low-income households and large Asian immigrant population, discretionary spending is likely limited. Many residents need to prioritize essential expenses",
    "accessibility": "The area has high transit dependency (33.9% no vehicle households) while also having significant car usage (41.1% drive alone). Transit accounts for 24.4% of commutes, indicating the importance of both modes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) to balance service improvements with cost burden. 3. Include some driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit the large transit-dependent population. 5. Consider proposals that maintain reasonable driving costs for the significant driving population"
