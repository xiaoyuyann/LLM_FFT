    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a median income of $57,591, with 44.8% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests many residents have limited disposable income and would be sensitive to increased transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and cost of living in Chicago, many Rogers Park residents likely have modest discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would notably impact their purchasing power.",
    "accessibility": "The community has high transit usage (28.1%) and low car ownership (37.2% have no vehicle). The area is served by CTA Red Line and multiple bus routes, making transit accessibility crucial for residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) given high transit dependency and lower incomes. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Selected lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Considered that 39.3% drive alone and need reasonable driving costs."
