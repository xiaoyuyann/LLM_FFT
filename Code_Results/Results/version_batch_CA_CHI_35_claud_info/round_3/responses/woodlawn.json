    "disposable_income": "Woodlawn has relatively low income levels with median income of $29,969 and 44.5% households earning less than $25,000. This suggests high sensitivity to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially for basic necessities.",
    "accessibility": "38.1% have no vehicle access, 24.3% use transit, and 45.4% drive alone. The community needs both affordable transit options and reasonable driving costs. Current transit travel times are significantly higher than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) given high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Favored lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements for both transit and driving. 5. Selected proposal 1 as top choice for combining low transit fare, low tax, moderate driving fee, and good travel time improvements."
