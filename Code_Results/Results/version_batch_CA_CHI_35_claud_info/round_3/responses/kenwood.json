    "disposable_income": "Kenwood shows a mixed income profile with 45% making under $50K and 33.2% making over $100K. The median income of $58,052 suggests moderate disposable income, though there's significant variation",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many residents would be sensitive to increased taxes and fees. About 27.4% making under $25K would be particularly impacted by any cost increases",
    "accessibility": "High transit dependency with 33.1% having no vehicle. 23.1% use transit and 23.2% work from home. 40.1% drive alone, showing a mixed transportation need. Good balance of transit and driving needs to be maintained",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to high percentage of no-vehicle households and transit users. 2. Moderate tax increase acceptable to maintain service quality. 3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts on lower-income residents. 5. Consider policies that reduce both transit and driving times to serve diverse travel needs"
