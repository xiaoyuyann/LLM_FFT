    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is a relatively affluent community with median income of $120,024 and 59.4% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can absorb moderate transportation cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($57,872), residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. However, the 22.6% of households earning under $50,000 need to be considered in policy impacts on consumption",
    "accessibility": "The community is heavily car-dependent with 93.5% of households owning cars and 74.9% driving for commuting. Only 8.4% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility or preference for driving",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and usage, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve traffic flow. 2. Higher sales tax is viable given high disposable incomes. 3. Moderate transit fares are preferred to maintain service while not overly burdening lower-income residents. 4. Prioritized policies that significantly reduce car travel times given dominant driving mode. 5. Selected options that balance revenue generation for transit improvements while maintaining reasonable costs for both drivers and transit users"
