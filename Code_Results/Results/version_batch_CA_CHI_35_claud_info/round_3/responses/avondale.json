    "disposable_income": "Mixed-income community with 43.5% making $100k+ but also 32.6% under $50k. About 15.6% are low-income (<$25k), suggesting sensitivity to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many households have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity, but a significant portion may be cost-sensitive to both transit fares and sales tax increases",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transportation needs - 19.8% no vehicle, 48.2% one vehicle. 49.7% drive alone, 21.5% use transit, indicating need for both car and transit options. Good balance needed between transit service improvements and driving costs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals that balance transit improvement with moderate cost impact given mixed income levels. 2. Consider high transit usage (21.5%) and car-dependent population (49.7% drive alone). 3. Lower sales tax preferred due to significant low/middle income population. 4. Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit times while keeping fares affordable"
