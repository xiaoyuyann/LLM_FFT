    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a median household income of $72,159, with a diverse income distribution. About 33.8% of households earn less than $50,000, while 34.4% earn over $100,000. This suggests varying levels of sensitivity to transportation costs across the community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $38,718, residents have moderate discretionary spending power. Higher sales taxes would impact all residents' purchasing power, particularly affecting the 33.8% of households with lower incomes who have less flexible budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The community shows mixed transportation patterns: 48.3% drive alone, 16% use transit, and 17.8% have no vehicle. Most households (45.6%) have one vehicle, suggesting many residents rely on both driving and transit options. The area needs balanced policies that serve both drivers and transit users.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposal 13 as it offers balanced improvements with moderate costs (1% tax, $1.25 fare, $0.50 driving fee), reducing both car and transit times significantly. 2. Selected proposal 10 second as it maintains lower transit fares ($0.75) while improving service. 3. Chose proposal 4 third as it keeps taxes lower (0.5%) while still improving transit times. 4. Ranked proposal 22 fourth as it provides good service improvements despite higher tax. 5. Selected proposal 1 fifth as it maintains low costs while offering modest improvements. These choices balance the needs of both drivers and transit users while considering the community's mixed income levels and transportation patterns."
