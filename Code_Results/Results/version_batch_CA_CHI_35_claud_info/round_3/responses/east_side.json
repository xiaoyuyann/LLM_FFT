    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $61,898, which is moderate. 41.8% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, suggesting many families need to be cost-conscious. The per capita income of $25,646 indicates limited discretionary spending power.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large average household size of 3.2 and significant portion of moderate-income households, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets meaningfully given the income distribution.",
    "accessibility": "90.5% of households own at least one vehicle, with 53.4% owning 2+ vehicles. 68.4% drive alone to work, while only 7.7% use transit. Mean commute time is 36.4 minutes, suggesting significant travel needs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) due to moderate income levels and large household sizes. 2. Favor moderate transit fares ($1.25) to balance service quality with affordability. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening the car-dependent majority. 4. Focus on options that reduce current 36.4-minute average commute times. 5. Consider high car ownership rates while seeking modest mode shift incentives."
