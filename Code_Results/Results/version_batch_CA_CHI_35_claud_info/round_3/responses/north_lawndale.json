    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale is a low-income community with 63% of households making less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $33,334. This suggests residents are particularly sensitive to cost increases from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, as would increased transit fares or driving fees given the community's reliance on both modes.",
    "accessibility": "36.5% of households have no vehicle, while 40.7% have one vehicle. 23.7% use transit for commuting while 57.3% drive alone. This split suggests policies need to balance both transit and driving accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest tax rate (0.5%) to minimize impact on purchasing power. 2. With high transit usage, favor lower transit fares to maintain accessibility. 3. Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Proposals 1, 4, 10, 3, and 0 offer the best combination of low taxes, affordable fares, and improved service."
