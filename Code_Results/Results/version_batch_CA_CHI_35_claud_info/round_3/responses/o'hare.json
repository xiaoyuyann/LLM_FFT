    "disposable_income": "Median income is $62,264, with about 37.5% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents somewhat sensitive to cost increases but not severely constrained.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.2, discretionary spending capacity is moderate. Higher sales taxes would have a noticeable but not devastating impact on household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "High car dependency with 91.3% households having at least one vehicle and 67.5% driving alone to work. Only 14.4% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility. The community's location near O'Hare airport makes efficient transportation crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and driving rates, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they reduce congestion\n2. Moderate transit fares preferred to maintain service while keeping transit affordable for the 14.4% transit users\n3. Lower sales tax rates preferred due to moderate income levels\n4. Prioritized policies that balance car travel time improvements with reasonable costs\n5. Considered policies that could encourage more transit use without severely penalizing necessary car travel"
