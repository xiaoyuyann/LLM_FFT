    "disposable_income": "The Near West Side has relatively high income levels with median household income of $106,955 and 52.9% of households making over $100,000. However, there's income diversity with 17.9% making under $25,000",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high per capita income ($72,602), many residents have significant discretionary spending power and can absorb moderate tax/fee increases. However, policies need to consider the 29.1% making under $50,000",
    "accessibility": "The area has diverse transportation usage: 34.3% have no vehicle, 18.1% use transit, 24.1% walk/bike, and 33.9% drive. The community is well-served by multiple transportation options and has good transit access",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized balanced policies that improve both transit and driving times without excessive cost burden. 2. Considered the high percentage of no-vehicle households (34.3%) needing affordable transit. 3. Accounted for significant walking/biking population (24.1%) benefiting from reduced traffic. 4. Selected policies with moderate fees/taxes given the income diversity. 5. Favored proposals reducing transit times given the substantial transit-dependent population"
