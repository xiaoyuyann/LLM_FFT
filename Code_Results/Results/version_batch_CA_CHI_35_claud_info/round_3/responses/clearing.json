    "disposable_income": "Clearing has a median household income of $73,778, with 49.2% of households earning over $75,000. However, 32.8% earn under $50,000, indicating a mixed income distribution that needs consideration for transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a moderate per capita income of $33,089, residents have some discretionary spending power but would be sensitive to increased transportation costs and sales taxes, particularly the 32.8% lower-income households",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with 91.6% of households owning cars (74.1% drive alone to work). Only 6.9% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility. Mean commute time is 31.9 minutes",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car ownership and usage, prioritize proposals with lower driving fees and moderate transit improvements. 2) Consider moderate sales tax to improve transit while not overly burdening household budgets. 3) Balance fare levels to maintain transit affordability while funding improvements. 4) Focus on proposals that reduce commute times for both drivers and transit users. 5) Select options that don't excessively impact discretionary spending power of lower-income households"
