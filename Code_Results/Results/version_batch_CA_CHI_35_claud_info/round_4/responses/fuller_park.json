    "disposable_income": "Fuller Park is a low-income community with 70% of households earning less than $25,000 annually, making residents highly sensitive to any cost increases in transportation or taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, making them vulnerable to any additional transportation costs or sales tax increases",
    "accessibility": "58% of households have no vehicle, making transit accessibility crucial. Currently 18.7% use transit and 49.3% drive alone, while 22.6% carpool, suggesting a mixed dependency on both transit and car travel",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) due to high poverty rates. 2. Favor lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect limited disposable income. 3. Consider moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without excessive burden. 4. Balance between transit time improvements and cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs affordable for low-income residents"
