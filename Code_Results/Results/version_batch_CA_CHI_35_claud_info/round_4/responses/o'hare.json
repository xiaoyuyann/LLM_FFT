    "disposable_income": "Median income is $62,264, with about 37.5% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents somewhat sensitive to cost increases but not severely constrained.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.2, most households have moderate discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would impact consumption but not drastically for most residents.",
    "accessibility": "High car dependency with 91.3% households having at least one vehicle and 67.5% driving alone to work. Only 14.4% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility. The community needs balanced improvements in both driving and transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with moderate tax rates (1%) to balance revenue generation and household burden. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion without excessive costs, given high car dependency. 3. Selected lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage transit use while maintaining service quality. 4. Considered travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transportation needs. 5. Balanced overall cost impact on moderate-income households."
