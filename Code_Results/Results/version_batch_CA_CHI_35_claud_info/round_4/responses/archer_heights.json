    "disposable_income": "Moderate to low-income community with 46.3% households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests sensitivity to cost increases from taxes, fares, and fees",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity for many residents, making them vulnerable to increased transportation costs and sales tax impacts",
    "accessibility": "High car dependency (78.1% drive alone or carpool), but significant transit reliance (13.1%) and no-vehicle households (23.7%). Mixed transportation needs must be balanced",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower tax burden due to income constraints. 2. Balance transit affordability for no-car households while maintaining reasonable driving costs for majority. 3. Favor proposals with moderate fees that improve both transit and driving times. 4. Consider 0.5-1.0% tax range to maintain service quality without excessive burden. 5. Avoid highest fare/fee combinations that would strain household budgets"
