    "disposable_income": "High disposable income with median household income of $121,562 and 58.8% of households making over $100,000. This suggests residents can generally absorb higher transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "High discretionary spending capacity given the affluent population. The 1.5% tax would impact larger purchases but is manageable for most residents given their income levels",
    "accessibility": "Excellent multi-modal accessibility with 45.6% no-car households, high transit usage (18.9%), and significant walk/bike share (27.6%). Area has good transit infrastructure and many residents rely on non-car transportation",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high income levels, prioritized policies that improve transit service and reduce congestion over cost savings. 2. Large car-free population benefits from better transit service. 3. High walking/biking share suggests support for reducing car traffic. 4. Selected policies with higher driver fees to discourage driving and fund transit improvements. 5. Higher tax rates acceptable given income levels if they improve service. 6. Ranked proposals that significantly reduce transit travel times while accepting moderate cost increases"
