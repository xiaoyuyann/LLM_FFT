    "disposable_income": "Brighton Park is a working-class community with median income of $52,145, significantly below Chicago's average. 47.9% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large Hispanic population (80%) and average household size of 3.2, many families likely have limited discretionary spending capacity after essential expenses. Higher sales taxes would notably impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "84.6% of households own at least one vehicle, with driving alone (58.8%) and carpooling (17.8%) being primary commute modes. Transit usage is moderate at 15.1%, suggesting some transit dependency but car-centric transportation",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given limited disposable income, prefer lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on household budgets\n2. With significant car dependency, avoid highest driving fees to protect working families\n3. Lower transit fares preferred to support transit-dependent population\n4. Balance between improved transit service and cost burden\n5. Moderate driving fees acceptable to reduce congestion while not overly burdening drivers"
