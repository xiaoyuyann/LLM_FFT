    "disposable_income": "The community has relatively low income levels with 42.2% households earning less than $25,000 and median income of $36,360. This suggests high sensitivity to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($18,503) and high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "38.7% of households have no vehicle available, and 27.9% rely on transit for commuting. Mean commute time is 36.1 minutes, suggesting significant dependence on public transportation despite longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without excessive burden. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts. 5. Consider high percentage of car-free households and transit users."
