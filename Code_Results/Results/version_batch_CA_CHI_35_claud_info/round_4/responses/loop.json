    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a relatively wealthy area with 61.3% of households earning over $100,000 annually. However, there's income diversity with about 20% earning under $50,000. This suggests most residents can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high income levels, residents likely have significant discretionary spending. The 1-1.5% sales tax impact would be notable given higher consumption levels, but manageable for most residents.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit access and walkability, with only 22.7% using cars as primary transport. 50.5% of households don't own vehicles, and 47.9% primarily walk/bike/use transit. The Loop is a transit-rich environment with multiple L lines and bus routes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that improve transit times given high transit usage. 2. Consider moderate fare increases acceptable given income levels. 3. Support driving fees to reduce congestion and fund transit, as most residents don't drive. 4. Balance higher taxes against service improvements. 5. Selected policies that significantly improve transit times while keeping fares reasonable. Ranked proposals that combine moderate-to-high driving fees with moderate transit fares and taxes, as these best serve the majority transit/walking population while managing costs."
