    "disposable_income": "Dunning has relatively high disposable income with 41.1% of households earning over $100,000. However, 29.3% earn under $50,000, indicating income diversity that needs consideration",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 93.7% of households owning at least one vehicle and high car dependency (72.1% drive alone), residents likely have significant transportation expenses. Higher-income households have more flexibility to absorb increased costs",
    "accessibility": "The area shows heavy car reliance with low transit usage (7.3%) and walk/bike (1.2%). This suggests limited transit accessibility currently, though most households can afford car ownership",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with moderate tax increases to improve transit while keeping driving viable, given high car dependency. 2. Avoid highest driving fees since majority are car-dependent. 3. Support moderate transit fares to improve service without overburdening lower-income residents. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals 13, 14, 4, 22, and 5 as they offer good transit improvements while maintaining reasonable driving conditions"
