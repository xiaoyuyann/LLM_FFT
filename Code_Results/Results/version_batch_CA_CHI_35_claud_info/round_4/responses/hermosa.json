    "disposable_income": "Hermosa has a median household income of $66,073, with about 38% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents sensitive to both transit fares and sales tax increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 3.1, discretionary spending is likely constrained. A significant portion of income goes to essential needs, making residents vulnerable to increased transportation costs and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "87.5% of households own at least one vehicle, with 60.9% driving alone to work and 17.7% using transit. This indicates strong car dependency but also notable transit usage, suggesting need for balanced policy.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Selected lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to support transit-dependent population. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Considered high car ownership rates while maintaining affordable transit options."
