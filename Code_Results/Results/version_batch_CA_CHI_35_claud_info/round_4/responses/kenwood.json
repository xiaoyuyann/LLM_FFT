    "disposable_income": "Kenwood shows significant income diversity with 45% making under $50K and 33.2% making over $100K. Median income is $58,052, suggesting moderate disposable income but with many residents sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 1.8, many households have limited discretionary spending power. Higher taxes and fees would impact the 45% lower-income residents significantly",
    "accessibility": "33.1% have no vehicle, 50.3% have one vehicle. Transit usage is significant at 23.1%, while 40.1% drive alone. Good balance of transit and driving needs to be maintained",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Need to balance transit affordability for no-car households (33.1%) while maintaining service quality. 2. Lower sales tax preferred due to large lower-income population. 3. Moderate driving fees acceptable as 40.1% drive alone and could help fund transit. 4. Lower transit fares prioritized to help transit-dependent residents. 5. Proposals balancing improved transit times without excessive costs ranked highest"
