    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Park is an affluent area with median household income of $134,277 and 61.3% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can absorb moderate increases in transportation costs",

    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies that improve transit times given high transit usage. 2. Moderate fare increases acceptable given high income levels. 3. Support for driving fees to reduce congestion and fund transit. 4. Balanced approach to sales tax given high discretionary spending. 5.
