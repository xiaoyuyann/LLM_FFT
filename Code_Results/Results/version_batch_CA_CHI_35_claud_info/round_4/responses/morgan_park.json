    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a mixed income profile with median income of $71,683. About 39.5% of households earn less than $50,000, while 34.7% earn over $100,000. This suggests careful consideration of fare and tax impacts across income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With per capita income of $39,283, residents have moderate discretionary spending power. Higher sales taxes would impact all residents, particularly the 39.5% lower-income households who have less flexible budgets.",
    "accessibility": "64.9% drive alone and 9.5% use transit for commuting. 88.7% of households have at least one vehicle, indicating high car dependency. However, transit access needs to be maintained for the 11.3% of households without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending power. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening the car-dependent majority. 3. Selected moderate transit fares ($1.25) to balance transit funding with affordability. 4. Considered travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transportation needs. 5. Aimed to maintain transit accessibility for car-less households while not overly penalizing necessary car usage."
