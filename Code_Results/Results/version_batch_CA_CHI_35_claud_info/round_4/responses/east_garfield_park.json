    "disposable_income": "Very low disposable income with median household income of $31,762 and 43.7% households earning less than $25,000. This suggests high sensitivity to any additional costs from taxes, fares, or driving fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to low income levels. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact already constrained household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "40% of households have no vehicle, 25% use transit for commuting, and mean commute time is 35.1 minutes. Strong reliance on both public transit and driving (51% drive alone), suggesting need for balanced policy that maintains affordability of both modes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fare ($0.75) due to high poverty rates and transit dependency. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) acceptable to improve transit service without excessive burden on drivers. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden crucial given mixed-mode reliance. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping combined costs manageable for low-income population."
