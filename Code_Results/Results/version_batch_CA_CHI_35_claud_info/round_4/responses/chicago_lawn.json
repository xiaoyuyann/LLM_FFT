    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn has relatively low income levels with median income of $43,293 and 55.3% of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income and high sensitivity to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($20,907) and large household sizes (avg 3.0), discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "24.3% have no vehicle access, while 39.8% have one vehicle. Transit usage (14.9%) is moderate, with driving alone (57.8%) and carpooling (20.6%) being primary modes. This suggests need for both affordable transit and driving options.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized low tax rates (0.5%) due to limited disposable income. 2. Favored low transit fares ($0.75) to help car-less households. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Considered high carpooling rates suggesting price sensitivity to driving costs."
