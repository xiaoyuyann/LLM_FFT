    "disposable_income": "North Center is an affluent area with median income of $148,585 and 67.4% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high incomes, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would impact this spending, but the community could better absorb these costs compared to lower-income areas",
    "accessibility": "The area has diverse transportation usage: 38.6% drive alone, 20% use transit, and 29.2% work from home. 87.4% of households have at least one vehicle, showing good car access. The community would benefit from both improved driving and transit conditions",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, prioritize policies that optimize travel times over cost savings. 2. Balance improvements for both drivers and transit users since both modes are significant. 3. Higher tax rates are acceptable if they yield better service, given income levels. 4. Moderate driving fees can help fund improvements while managing congestion. 5. Selected policies that reduce transit times below 52 minutes and driving times below 19 minutes"
