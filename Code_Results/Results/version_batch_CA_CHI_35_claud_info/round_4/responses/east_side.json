    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $61,898, which is moderate. 41.8% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, suggesting many families need to be cost-conscious. The per capita income of $25,646 indicates limited discretionary spending power.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large Hispanic population (86.8%) and moderate income levels, many households likely have significant essential expenses given the average household size of 3.2 people. Higher taxes and transportation costs would notably impact discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Car-dependent community with 90.5% of households having at least one vehicle. 68.4% drive alone to work, while only 7.7% use transit. Mean commute time is 36.4 minutes, suggesting significant travel distances.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) due to limited disposable income. 2. Given high car dependency, avoid highest driving fees. 3. Balance transit improvements with cost burden - moderate fare increases acceptable if they improve service. 4. Consider proposals that reduce commute times without excessive cost increases. 5. Selected proposals that maintain affordability while providing modest service improvements."
