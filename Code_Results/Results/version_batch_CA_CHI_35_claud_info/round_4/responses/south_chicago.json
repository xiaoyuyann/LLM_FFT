    "disposable_income": "South Chicago has relatively low income levels with median income of $43,936 and 55.6% households earning less than $50,000. About 30.9% earn less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets, especially for the large proportion of low-income households",
    "accessibility": "31.6% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% rely on transit for commuting. While 58.2% drive alone, the high proportion of transit-dependent residents suggests need for affordable and efficient transit service",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help transit-dependent residents. 3. Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden on residents. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit the significant transit-riding population"
