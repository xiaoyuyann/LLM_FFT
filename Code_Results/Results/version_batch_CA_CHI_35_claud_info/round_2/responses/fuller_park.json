    "disposable_income": "Fuller Park is a low-income community with 70% of households earning less than $25,000 annually, making residents highly sensitive to any cost increases in transportation or taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, making them vulnerable to any additional transportation costs or sales tax increases",
    "accessibility": "58% of households have no vehicle, making transit accessibility crucial. Current mode split shows 18.7% transit use, 49.3% drive alone, and 22.6% carpool, indicating heavy reliance on both transit and shared car usage",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) due to low income levels. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without excessive burden. 4. Balance between transit time improvements and cost burden. 5. Consider high carpool usage suggesting some flexibility between modes."
