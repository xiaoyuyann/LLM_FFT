    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a relatively low median income of $43,048, with 53.6% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to transportation costs and tax increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 35.5% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact household budgets and reduce spending on other essential needs.",
    "accessibility": "30.3% of households have no vehicle, and 21.4% use transit for commuting. The community heavily relies on both public transit and personal vehicles (49.3% drive alone), suggesting a need for balanced transportation options with affordable fares.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) due to high percentage of low-income households and transit users. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Selected lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost considerations. 5. Considered the high proportion of both transit-dependent and car-dependent residents."
