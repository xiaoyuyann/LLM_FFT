    "disposable_income": "Dunning has relatively high disposable income with 41.1% of households earning over $100,000. However, 29.3% earn under $50,000, indicating income diversity that needs consideration",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 93.7% of households owning at least one vehicle and high car dependency (72.1% drive alone), residents likely have significant transportation expenses. Higher-income households have more flexibility to absorb increased costs",
    "accessibility": "The area shows heavy car reliance with low transit usage (7.3%) and walk/bike (1.2%). This suggests limited transit accessibility currently, though most households can afford car ownership",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with moderate tax increases to improve transit while not overly burdening lower-income residents. 2. Support moderate driving fees to reduce congestion given high car usage. 3. Keep transit fares moderate to encourage more transit use. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost increases. 5. Selected proposals 13, 14, 22, 23, 10 as they offer good transit time improvements with reasonable cost increases, considering the community's car-dependent nature but need for better transit options"
