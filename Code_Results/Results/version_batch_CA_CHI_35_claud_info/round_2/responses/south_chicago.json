    "disposable_income": "South Chicago is a lower-income community with median income of $43,936, significantly below Chicago's average. About 55.6% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, indicating limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households and average household size of 2.7, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "31.6% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% rely on transit for commuting. Combined with 58.2% who drive alone, the community needs balanced transportation options. Both transit affordability and reasonable driving costs are important",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) given high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Favored lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) accepted as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements for both modes. 5. Considered high percentage of both transit users and drivers in final ranking"
