    "disposable_income": "West Englewood is a low-income community with median income of $29,234, significantly below Chicago's average. 69.5% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, with 42.1% earning less than $25,000, indicating very limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact their ability to afford basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "32.7% of households have no vehicle, and 25.9% rely on public transit for commuting. Combined with 55.6% who drive alone, the community needs both affordable transit and reasonable driving costs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lowest transit fares ($0.75) due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Favored lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect limited discretionary income. 3. Balanced driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs affordable. 5. Considered high percentage of no-vehicle households needing reliable transit service"
