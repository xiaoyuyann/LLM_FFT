    "disposable_income": "Clearing has a median household income of $73,778, with 49.2% of households earning over $75,000. However, 32.8% earn less than $50,000, indicating a mixed income distribution that needs consideration for transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a moderate per capita income of $33,089, residents have some discretionary spending power but need to balance transportation costs. Higher sales taxes would impact all residents' purchasing power, particularly affecting the 32.8% lower-income households",
    "accessibility": "The community is heavily car-dependent with 91.7% of households owning at least one vehicle and 74.1% driving alone to work. Only 6.9% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility. Mean commute time is 31.9 minutes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, prefer policies with lower driving fees but improved transit times. 2. Consider moderate sales tax to balance service improvements with household budgets. 3. Lower transit fares could encourage more transit use while supporting lower-income residents. 4. Prioritize policies that reduce overall commute times for both drivers and transit users. 5. Balance revenue generation for transit improvements with cost burden on residents"
