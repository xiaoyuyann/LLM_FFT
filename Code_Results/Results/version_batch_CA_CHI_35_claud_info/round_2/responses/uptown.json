    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high percentage of lower-income households (23.2% under $25k), many residents are sensitive to additional taxes and fees. Higher-income households have more flexibility in transportation choices",
    "accessibility": "Strong transit usage (34.9% commute by transit) and high percentage of car-free households (42.1%). Good transit access with multiple bus and rail options. Only 32.5% drive alone to work",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to high transit dependency and lower-income population\n2. Moderate tax rates to balance service improvements with cost burden\n3. Support driving fees to improve transit service without directly impacting transit users\n4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time\n5. Consider high percentage of no-car households means many won't pay driving fees"
