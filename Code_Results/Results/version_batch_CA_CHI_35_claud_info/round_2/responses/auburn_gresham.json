    "disposable_income": "Auburn Gresham is a lower-income community with median income of $41,000 and 56.8% of households making less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income and high sensitivity to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households and per capita income of $23,557, residents likely have limited discretionary spending. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact their ability to purchase other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "29.9% of households have no vehicle, and 21.1% rely on transit for commuting. While 57.5% drive alone, the high no-vehicle rate indicates transit accessibility is crucial. The community needs balanced policies that maintain both transit and driving affordability.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on purchasing power. 2. Selected proposals with moderate to low transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help the significant transit-dependent population. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening the majority who drive. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Prioritized proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility for no-vehicle households."
