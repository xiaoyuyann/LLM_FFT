    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Park is an affluent area with median household income of $134,277 and 61.3% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($109,538), residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. The impact of sales tax increases (0.5-1.5%) would be noticeable but not severely burdensome given the wealth levels",
    "accessibility": "The area has high transit usage (33.4%) and low car dependency (32.3% no vehicle, 47.8% one vehicle). Good mix of transportation options with significant walk/bike share (9.3%). Many residents use multiple modes of transport",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies that improve transit times while keeping fares moderate, given high transit usage. 2. Moderate driving fees acceptable as many residents don't own cars. 3. Higher sales tax tolerable given high incomes. 4. Balanced approach favoring proposals that reduce both transit and driving times. 5. Considered that many residents use multiple modes and would benefit from system-wide improvements"
