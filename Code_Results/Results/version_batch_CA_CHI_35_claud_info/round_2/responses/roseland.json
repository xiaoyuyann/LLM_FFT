    "disposable_income": "Roseland has relatively low income levels with median income of $49,808 and 50.1% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs and sales tax increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($24,754) and high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "25.9% of households have no vehicle, and 20.1% use transit for work commutes. Good transit service is essential. 53.9% drive alone, so driving costs also matter significantly.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) given income constraints and transit dependency. 2. Favored lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times below 55 minutes while keeping costs affordable."
