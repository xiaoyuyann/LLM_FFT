Choose proposal 4 for lower tax impact while still improving travel times. 3. Select proposal 14 for best overall travel times despite higher costs. 4. Pick proposal 22 as it balances all factors with moderate tax/fee increases. 5. Include proposal 10 for its lower transit fare option while maintaining service improvements"
