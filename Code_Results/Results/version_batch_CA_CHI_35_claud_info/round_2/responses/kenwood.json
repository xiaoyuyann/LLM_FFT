    "disposable_income": "Kenwood shows significant income diversity with 45% making under $50K and 33.2% making over $100K. Median income is $58,052, suggesting moderate disposable income but with many residents sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and household sizes, many residents have limited discretionary spending power. Higher taxes and fees would impact the 45% lower-income households significantly",
    "accessibility": "High transit dependency with 33.1% having no vehicle. 23.1% use transit and 23.2% work from home. Good mix of transportation modes with 40.1% driving alone suggests need to balance both transit and driving improvements",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending power of lower-income residents. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 3. Selected lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to support the 23.1% transit users and 33.1% car-less households. 4. Balanced travel time improvements for both transit and driving given the mixed-mode usage. 5. Considered proposals that reduce transit travel times below 55 minutes while keeping driving times reasonable"
