    "disposable_income": "Median income is $54,139, with 45.5% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of households in lower income brackets and 23.6% having no vehicle, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Additional transportation costs would impact household budgets considerably.",
    "accessibility": "24.1% use transit and 23.6% have no vehicle, indicating significant transit dependency. 58.5% drive alone, showing balanced need for both transit and driving options. Good accessibility for both modes is important.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent population. 2. Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with tax burden. 3. Selected moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4. Considered travel time improvements for both transit and driving given mixed mode usage. 5. Balanced overall costs against community's limited disposable income."
