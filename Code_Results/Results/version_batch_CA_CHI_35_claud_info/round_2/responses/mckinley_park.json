Selected options that improve transit times without excessive driving fees, given the high car ownership and driving rates. 3. Considered the substantial transit-using population (21.7%) by ensuring transit remains affordable and efficient. 4. Avoided highest tax rates (1.5%) due to impact on discretionary spending. 5. Balanced driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening the majority who drive"
