    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a median household income of $72,159, with a diverse income distribution. About 33.8% of households earn less than $50,000, while 34.4% earn over $100,000. This suggests varying levels of sensitivity to transportation costs across the community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.4, many residents have moderate discretionary spending power. Higher sales taxes would impact all residents, but particularly the 33.8% of households earning below $50,000 who have less flexible budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The community shows mixed transportation patterns: 48.3% drive alone, 16% use transit, and 17.8% have no vehicle. With 45.6% having one vehicle, many households could switch between modes depending on costs and service quality.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposal 11 as it offers low transit fare ($0.75) with moderate tax (1%), improving transit times while keeping it affordable for lower-income residents. 2. Selected proposal 13 second as it balances moderate fare/tax with improved transit service. 3. Chose proposal 4 third for its low tax impact while improving transit times. 4. Ranked proposal 10 fourth as it maintains low transit fares with moderate improvements. 5. Selected proposal 14 fifth as it offers good transit improvements while keeping tax moderate."
