    "disposable_income": "Logan Square has a relatively high median income of $97,759 and per capita income of $62,532, with 48.9% of households earning over $100,000. However, there's income diversity with 24.5% earning under $50,000",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, most residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity. Higher-income households can better absorb increased transportation costs, while lower-income households (24.5%) would be more sensitive to fare and tax increases",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit access with 26.5% using public transit and 21.2% car-free households. 53.5% have one car, showing balanced multimodal transportation needs. The high work-from-home percentage (24.4%) suggests less daily commuting impact",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized balanced policies that maintain transit affordability while improving service quality, considering the mixed-income population. 2. Selected options with moderate tax increases to support transit without overly burdening lower-income residents. 3. Supported modest driving fees to reduce congestion and fund transit, given the high car ownership. 4. Considered the large transit-dependent population (21.2% no vehicle). 5. Factored in the significant work-from-home population that may need occasional rather than daily transit access"
