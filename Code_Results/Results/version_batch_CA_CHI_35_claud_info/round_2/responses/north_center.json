    "disposable_income": "North Center is an affluent area with median income of $148,585 and 67.4% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high incomes, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would impact this but would be relatively manageable given the wealth level. Annual consumption is likely high, making sales tax a notable consideration",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transportation options with 87.4% of households having at least one vehicle. 38.6% drive alone while 20% use transit. This suggests both modes are important but driving slightly preferred. 29.2% work from home which reduces daily commute impacts",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost savings. 2. Consider balance between driving and transit since both are significantly used. 3. Higher sales tax is acceptable if it improves service. 4. Moderate driving fees can help fund transit without excessive burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce travel times while keeping costs reasonable for both modes"
