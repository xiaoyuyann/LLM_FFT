    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park has a relatively high median household income of $90,740, with 44.1% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher income levels, residents have significant discretionary spending power. However, about 27% earn under $50,000, so cost impacts need to be considered for lower-income residents.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good car access (90.2% households have cars) and transit options (13.4% use transit for commuting). 61.7% drive alone to work, suggesting strong car dependency despite transit availability.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with moderate tax rates to maintain service quality while limiting impact on discretionary spending. 2. Given high car ownership and usage, favored proposals with lower driving fees to avoid excessive burden on majority of residents. 3. Selected proposals with moderate transit fares to keep transit accessible while generating revenue for improvements. 4. Balanced travel time improvements against cost increases. 5. Considered mixed-income nature of community when evaluating fee impacts."
