    "disposable_income": "Mixed-income community with 31.3% earning under $50k, 29.3% middle income ($50k-$100k), and 39.3% earning over $100k. This suggests varying levels of sensitivity to transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, about one-third of residents may have limited discretionary spending power and would be sensitive to fare increases and sales tax. Higher-income households (39.3%) have more flexibility to absorb increased costs",
    "accessibility": "Good mix of transportation options with 23.7% using transit and 45.5% driving alone. 19.1% have no vehicle, making transit accessibility crucial. The community has relatively high transit dependency while maintaining significant car usage",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that don't overly burden lower-income residents while improving transit service. 2. Consider the significant transit-dependent population (19.1% no vehicle). 3. Account for the 45.5% who drive alone and might switch to transit if service improves. 4. Selected policies that maintain lower fares while generating revenue through moderate driving fees and taxes. 5. Ranked proposals that reduce transit travel times without excessive cost increases"
