    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale is a low-income community with 63% of households making less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $33,334. This suggests residents are particularly sensitive to cost increases from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, as would increased transit fares or driving fees given the community's reliance on both modes.",
    "accessibility": "36.5% of households have no vehicle, while 40.7% have one vehicle. 23.7% use transit and 57.3% drive alone for commuting. This split suggests policies need to balance both transit and driving accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest combined costs (sales tax + fares/fees). 2. Need good transit service for car-less households while maintaining reasonable driving costs for car owners. 3. Prefer 0.5-1.0% tax range to balance service needs with tax burden. 4. Moderate fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable. 5. Low to moderate driving fees to manage congestion without excessive burden."
