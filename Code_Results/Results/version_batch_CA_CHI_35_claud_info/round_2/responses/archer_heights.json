    "disposable_income": "Mixed-income community with 46.3% households earning under $50k, indicating significant budget constraints for many residents. About 29.5% earn over $100k, showing income diversity",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high percentage of lower-income households, many residents would be sensitive to increased taxes and fees. Higher sales tax would significantly impact discretionary spending for the 46.3% earning under $50k",
    "accessibility": "76.3% of households have at least one vehicle, with high drive-alone (58.7%) and carpool (19.4%) rates. Transit usage is moderate at 13.1%, suggesting some transit dependency but primarily car-oriented community",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) due to large lower-income population. 2. Balance between transit improvement and driving costs since majority are drivers but significant transit minority exists. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) preferred over high fees ($1.00) to avoid excessive burden on majority driving population. 4. Lower transit fares preferred to support transit-dependent population (23.7% no vehicle). 5. Focus on options that reduce transit travel time while maintaining reasonable driving conditions"
