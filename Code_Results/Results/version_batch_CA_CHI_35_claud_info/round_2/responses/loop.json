    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a relatively wealthy area with 61.3% of households earning over $100,000 annually. However, there is income diversity with about 20% earning under $50,000. This suggests most residents can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high income levels, residents likely have significant discretionary spending. The 1-1.5% sales tax impact would be notable but manageable for most residents. The area has high retail spending due to its commercial nature.",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent transit accessibility with multiple L lines and bus routes. 50.5% of households don't own cars, and only 22.7% drive to work. Walking/biking (27.3%) and transit (20.6%) are major commute modes. The area is very walkable with high density of services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that improve transit times given high transit usage. 2. Higher driving fees acceptable since half of residents don't own cars. 3. Can tolerate moderate fare increases given income levels. 4. Sales tax impact is significant but manageable. 5. Selected policies that balance transit improvement with moderate cost increases. 6. Ranked proposals favoring reduced transit times while maintaining reasonable fares for lower-income residents."
