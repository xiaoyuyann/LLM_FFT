    "disposable_income": "Median income is $68,436, with a diverse income distribution. About 36.7% earn less than $50,000, while 30.1% earn over $100,000. Per capita income of $39,867 suggests moderate disposable income levels",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many households have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes and transportation costs would significantly impact the 36.7% of households earning under $50,000",
    "accessibility": "Car-dependent community with 80.5% having at least one vehicle. 52.3% drive alone to work, while 19.5% use transit. 19.4% have no vehicle access, making transit accessibility crucial for these households",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending power. 2. Balance transit fares to maintain service quality while keeping costs accessible for the 19.5% transit users. 3. Moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening the 52.3% who drive alone. 4. Consider travel time improvements for both modes given the mixed-mode usage. 5. Selected policies that minimize total cost impact while maximizing service improvements"
