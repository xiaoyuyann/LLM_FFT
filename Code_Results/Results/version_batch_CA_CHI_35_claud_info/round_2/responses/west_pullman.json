    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has relatively low income levels with median income of $46,861 and 52.3% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower income levels and larger household sizes (2.7 average), discretionary spending is likely limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets given the high percentage of lower-income residents.",
    "accessibility": "23.4% of households have no vehicle, making transit access critical. However, only 12% currently use transit while 75.8% drive/carpool, suggesting current transit service may be inadequate. Travel times show significant transit disadvantage (58.8 min vs 21 min driving).",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help car-less households and encourage transit use. 2. Favor lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) due to limited discretionary income. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to fund transit while not overly burdening majority who drive. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Selected policies that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents."
