    "disposable_income": "Brighton Park is a working-class community with median income of $52,145, significantly below Chicago's average. About 48% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large proportion of lower and middle-income households, residents are price-sensitive to both transit fares and sales tax increases. The community has high household sizes (3.2 average), suggesting multiple dependents and careful budgeting of discretionary spending",
    "accessibility": "84.5% of households own at least one vehicle, with driving alone (58.8%) and carpooling (17.8%) being primary commute modes. Transit usage is moderate at 15.1%, while 15.4% of households have no vehicle access, indicating need for affordable transit options",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on household budgets given income constraints. 2. Favored moderate transit fares ($1.25) to balance service quality with affordability. 3. Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening the majority who drive. 4. Considered travel time improvements for both transit and driving given mixed modal split. 5. Selected proposals that provide best combined benefits for both transit-dependent and driving households while minimizing financial burden"
