    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $69,810, with about 37.7% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests many residents have limited disposable income and would be sensitive to increased transportation costs and sales tax.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.4, many families likely have modest discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would impact their purchasing power for essential and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "The area has mixed transportation usage with 43.8% driving alone, 24.5% using transit, and 23.8% households without vehicles. Good transit access is crucial for many residents, while drivers also need consideration.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Balanced transit fares around $1.25 to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4. Considered travel time improvements for both modes given mixed usage. 5. Aimed to maintain transit accessibility for the 23.8% car-less households while not overly penalizing the 43.8% who drive to work."
