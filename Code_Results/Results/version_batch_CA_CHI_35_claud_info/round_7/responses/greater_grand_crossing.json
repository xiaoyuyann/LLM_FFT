    "disposable_income": "The community has relatively low income levels with 58.6% of households earning less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $39,908. This suggests limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low income levels and high percentage of households below poverty line, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "36.5% of households have no vehicle, and 29.5% rely on transit for commuting. Combined with 46.8% having just one vehicle, the community heavily depends on both public transit and car access. Transit accessibility is crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) given high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Favored lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect limited discretionary spending. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs affordable."
