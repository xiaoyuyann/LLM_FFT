    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon has a median household income of $64,441, with 40.5% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. The per capita income of $27,703 suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 3.3, many families likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher taxes and fees would significantly impact household budgets, especially for the 40.5% lower-income households",
    "accessibility": "76.1% of residents drive (59.6% alone, 16.5% carpool), while 12.9% use transit. 86.5% of households own at least one vehicle, indicating high car dependency. Mean commute time is 36.3 minutes, suggesting accessibility challenges",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower tax rates (0.5%) to protect discretionary income for predominantly working-class families. 2. Balance moderate transit fares ($1.25) to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable for 12.9% transit users. 3. Support modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening the 76.1% car commuters. 4. Avoid highest tax/fee combinations given limited household disposable income. 5. Consider travel time improvements that benefit both drivers and transit users"
