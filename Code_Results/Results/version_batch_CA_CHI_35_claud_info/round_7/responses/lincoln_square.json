    "disposable_income": "Lincoln Square has a relatively high median income of $90,569, with 45.2% of households earning over $100,000. However, there's income diversity with 25.7% earning under $50,000, suggesting varying levels of disposable income across the community",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $57,351, residents have moderate to high discretionary spending power. The higher-income households can better absorb increased transportation costs, but about quarter of households may be more sensitive to cost increases",
    "accessibility": "The community shows diverse transportation usage: 39.1% drive alone, 26% use transit, and 21.6% have no vehicle. Good mix of transit and driving accessibility, with 74.5% of households having at least one car",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized balanced policies that maintain transit affordability while improving service, given the significant transit-dependent population. 2. Considered moderate driving fees acceptable given high car ownership and income levels. 3. Preferred lower sales tax options due to impact on all residents. 4. Valued proposals that reduce transit travel time given high transit usage. 5. Selected options that balance cost impact with service improvements, considering the mixed-income population"
