    "disposable_income": "West Englewood is a low-income community with median income of $29,234, significantly below Chicago's average. 69.5% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, with 42.1% earning less than $25,000, indicating very limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact their ability to afford basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "32.7% of households have no vehicle, and 25.9% rely on transit for commuting. The community has high transit dependency despite having limited service. 55.6% drive alone, suggesting a need to balance both transit and driving costs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lowest transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that provide best transit service improvements while minimizing financial impact on low-income residents"
