    "disposable_income": "Kenwood shows significant income diversity with median income of $58,052. 45% of households earn less than $50,000, while 33.2% earn over $100,000. This suggests need to balance policies for different income groups.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 27.4% earning under $25,000, many residents are cost-sensitive to both transit fares and sales tax. Higher income households have more flexibility but still consider value of transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "33.1% have no vehicle access, making transit essential. 23.1% use transit and 40.1% drive alone for commuting. Good balance needed between transit service quality and driving costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help large no-car population. 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) balances revenue needs with cost burden. 3. Selected policies with driving fees to improve transit times while keeping fares affordable. 4. Considered mix of travel modes in community. 5. Aimed to minimize impact on lower-income residents while maintaining service quality."
