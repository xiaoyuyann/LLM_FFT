    "disposable_income": "North Center is an affluent area with median income of $148,585 and 67.4% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high incomes, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would impact this but would be relatively manageable given the wealth level. Annual consumption is likely high, making sales tax a notable consideration",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transportation options with 87.4% of households having at least one vehicle and 20% using transit for commuting. 29.2% work from home, reducing daily transportation needs. The area is well-served by both driving and transit infrastructure",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost savings. 2. Consider balanced approach between transit and driving given mixed mode usage. 3. Higher sales tax is acceptable if it improves service quality. 4. Look for proposals that reduce both transit and driving times. 5. Moderate fare/fee increases are acceptable for service improvements. Selected proposals that optimize travel times while keeping costs reasonable, given the area's ability to absorb higher costs for better service"
