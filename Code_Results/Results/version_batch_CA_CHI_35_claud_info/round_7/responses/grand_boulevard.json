    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has relatively low income levels with 53.6% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. The median income of $43,048 suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households and 30.3% having no vehicle, residents likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Additional taxes or fees would significantly impact their ability to purchase other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The community shows significant transit dependence with 21.4% using transit and 30.3% having no vehicle. However, 49.3% drive alone, indicating a mixed transportation need. The area needs balanced policies that maintain both transit and driving affordability.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) due to high transit dependency and low income levels. 2. Favor moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Select lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on discretionary spending. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost considerations. 5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel time to support the significant transit-dependent population."
