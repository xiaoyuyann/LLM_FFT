    "disposable_income": "Oakland has a relatively low median income of $27,693, with 47.2% of households earning less than $25,000. This suggests limited disposable income for most residents, making them particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary consumption is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact residents' already constrained budgets for essential needs.",
    "accessibility": "41.7% of households have no vehicle, and 40.4% have only one vehicle. Transit usage (19.9%) is significant, while 48.2% drive alone. The community needs affordable transit options while maintaining reasonable driving costs for those who depend on cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) due to low income levels. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to support the large car-less population. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs affordable for both transit users and drivers."
