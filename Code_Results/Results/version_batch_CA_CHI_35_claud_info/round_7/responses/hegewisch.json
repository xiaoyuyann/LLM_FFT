    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch has a median income of $58,647, with 45.6% households earning less than $50,000. The community has moderate disposable income, making residents sensitive to cost increases in transportation and sales tax",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and household sizes, discretionary spending is limited for many residents. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially for the 27.6% earning less than $25,000",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars (65.2% drive alone) with limited transit usage (10.8%). High car ownership (87.4% have at least one vehicle) suggests car-dependent infrastructure and lifestyle. Transit times are significantly longer than driving times",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Given high car dependency, avoid highest driving fees. 3. Balance transit improvement with cost burden. 4. Consider moderate fare increases that improve transit service without overburdening transit-dependent residents. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce both car and transit travel times while maintaining affordability"
