    "disposable_income": "North Park has a median income of $74,649, with 23.2% earning over $150,000 but also 34.3% earning under $50,000. This suggests a mixed-income community where transportation costs impact households differently",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $37,156, residents have moderate discretionary spending power. However, 14.6% of households have no vehicle, indicating transportation costs are a significant consideration",
    "accessibility": "55.6% drive alone while 17.5% use transit, suggesting good access to both modes. Mean commute time is 34 minutes, indicating room for improvement in transportation efficiency",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize balanced policies that improve transit service while keeping costs moderate given the mixed income levels. 2. Consider that 76.9% of households have 1-2 vehicles, so driving fees will affect many residents. 3. Focus on reducing commute times for both transit and car users. 4. Select policies that maintain affordability for lower-income residents while improving service. 5. Choose options that encourage transit use without severely penalizing necessary car usage"
