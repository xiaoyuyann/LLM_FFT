    "disposable_income": "South Deering has relatively low income levels with median income of $34,814 and 38.6% households earning less than $25,000. This suggests residents are particularly sensitive to cost increases from taxes, fares, and fees",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low income levels and high percentage of households below poverty line, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Any increase in transportation costs would significantly impact other essential spending",
    "accessibility": "24% have no vehicle access and 23.7% use transit for commuting, indicating significant transit dependency. However, 57.2% drive alone, suggesting need for balanced policy that doesn't overly burden drivers while improving transit",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritized lower tax/fare combinations first (0.5-1.0% tax range). 2. Selected policies that balance transit improvements with moderate driving fees since community has both transit users and drivers. 3. Avoided highest tax/fare/fee combinations due to financial burden. 4. Prioritized options that reduce transit travel time given significant transit dependency. 5. Considered moderate driving fees to fund transit while not overly burdening majority who drive"
