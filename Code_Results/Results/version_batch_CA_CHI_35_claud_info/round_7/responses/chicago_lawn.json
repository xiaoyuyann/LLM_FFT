    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn has relatively low income levels with median income of $43,293 and 55.3% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($20,907) and large household sizes (avg 3.0), discretionary spending is limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets given the high proportion of lower-income residents.",
    "accessibility": "24.3% have no vehicle access, while 39.8% have one vehicle. Transit usage (14.9%) is moderate, with driving alone (57.8%) and carpooling (20.6%) being primary modes. This suggests need for both affordable transit and reasonable driving costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to preserve purchasing power. 2. Balance lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help car-less households while maintaining service quality. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) can help fund transit without overly burdening car-dependent households. 4. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to help working population. 5. Avoided highest tax/fee combinations due to community's economic constraints."
