    "disposable_income": "The community has relatively low income levels with 65.4% of households earning less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $31,762. This suggests high sensitivity to any additional transportation costs or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($20,343) and high poverty rates, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact their ability to purchase other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "40% of households have no vehicle, and 25% rely on public transit for commuting. The mean commute time is 35.1 minutes, suggesting significant dependence on public transportation. Good transit service is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax rates. 2. High transit dependency means transit service quality is important. 3. With 40% car-free households, driving fees have less negative impact on residents while potentially improving transit. 4. Balance between keeping transit affordable and generating enough revenue for service improvements. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time while maintaining affordability."
