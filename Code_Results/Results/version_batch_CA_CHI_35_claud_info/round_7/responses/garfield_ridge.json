    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge has a relatively high median income of $90,374, with 46% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher income levels, residents have significant discretionary spending power. However, the community needs to balance transportation costs with other expenses, considering that about 30% of households earn less than $50,000.",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars, with 92.2% of households owning at least one vehicle and 71.2% driving alone to work. Only 7.6% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility or preference for driving. The high car ownership indicates good road infrastructure but potential congestion issues.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, policies with moderate driving fees are preferred to reduce congestion while not overly burdening drivers. 2. Lower transit fares could encourage more transit use from the 7.9% no-vehicle households. 3. Moderate tax rates balance service improvements with household budget impact. 4. Selected policies that reduce both car and transit travel times. 5. Considered the impact on lower-income households while maintaining service quality."
