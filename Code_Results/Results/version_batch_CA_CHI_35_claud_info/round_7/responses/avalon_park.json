    "disposable_income": "Median income is $54,139, with 45.5% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of households in lower income brackets and 23.6% having no vehicle, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Additional transportation costs would impact household budgets considerably.",
    "accessibility": "24.1% use transit and 23.6% have no vehicle, indicating significant transit dependency. 58.5% drive alone, showing balanced need for both transit and driving options. Current transit travel times are significantly higher than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent population. 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) to maintain service quality without overburdening low-income households. 3. Include some driving fees to improve transit service and reduce congestion. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost burden. 5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel time gap with driving."
