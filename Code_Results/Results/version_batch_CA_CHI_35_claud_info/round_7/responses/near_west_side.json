    "disposable_income": "The Near West Side has relatively high income levels with median household income of $106,955 and 52.9% of households making over $100,000. However, there's income diversity with 17.9% making under $25,000",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($72,602), many residents have significant discretionary spending power. Higher sales taxes would impact discretionary spending but may be more tolerable than in lower-income areas",
    "accessibility": "The area has diverse transportation usage: 34.3% have no vehicles, 18.1% use transit, 24.1% walk/bike, and 33.9% drive. Good transit access is important given the car-free population, while driving remains significant",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized balanced policies that improve both transit and driving times without excessive costs, given mixed transit/driving usage. 2. Moderate tax rates preferred given income diversity despite overall wealth. 3. Higher driving fees acceptable to fund transit given significant non-car households. 4. Lower transit fares important for equity given no-vehicle households. 5. Considered time savings relative to cost increases for both modes"
