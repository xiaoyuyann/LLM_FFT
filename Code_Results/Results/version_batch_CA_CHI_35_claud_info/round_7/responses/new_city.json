    "disposable_income": "New City has relatively low income levels with median income of $40,959 and 57.8% of households making less than $50,000. This suggests high sensitivity to costs from fares, fees, and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($21,622) and large household sizes (2.9 average), discretionary spending is likely limited. A 1% sales tax would cost about $216 annually per person, which is significant for this population.",
    "accessibility": "24.5% of households have no vehicle, and 17.9% use transit for commuting. However, 68.2% drive alone or carpool, indicating a mixed reliance on both transit and cars. Good transit access is important but driving costs impact many residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize proposals with lower taxes and fares while maintaining service quality. 2. Consider balance between transit and driving needs given mixed mode usage. 3. Favor proposals that reduce transit travel time without excessive cost burden. 4. Proposals with moderate driver fees can help fund transit improvements while managing congestion. 5. Selected proposals aim to minimize total cost impact while improving transit service."
