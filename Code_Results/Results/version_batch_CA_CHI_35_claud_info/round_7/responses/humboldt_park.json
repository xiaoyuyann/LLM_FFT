    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $51,105 and per capita income is $25,358, with 49% of households earning less than $50k annually. This indicates limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially considering 25% of households earn less than $25k annually.",
    "accessibility": "20.1% use transit for work commutes, 25% have no vehicles, and 40.8% have one vehicle. Mean commute time is 35.7 minutes. The community needs balanced access to both transit and driving options, with particular attention to transit affordability.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to high transit dependency and low income levels. 2. Moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Keep sales tax moderate to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balance between transit time improvements and cost burden. 5. Consider that 64.2% of households have 0-1 vehicles, indicating high transit reliance."
