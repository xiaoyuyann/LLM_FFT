    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class community with median income of $50,112 and nearly 50% of households earning less than $50,000. The per capita income of $19,524 indicates limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large proportion of lower-income households and average household size of 3.4, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Higher sales taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "20.5% of households have no vehicle, and 17.9% use transit for commuting. While 59.6% drive alone, the high proportion of 1-vehicle households (34.1%) suggests many families share vehicles. Good transit access is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help the large transit-dependent population and lower-income households. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Preferred lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending power. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Considered the high proportion of Hispanic/Latino residents who may have varying transportation needs and financial constraints."
