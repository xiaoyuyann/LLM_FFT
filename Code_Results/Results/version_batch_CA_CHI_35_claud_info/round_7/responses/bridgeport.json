    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a median household income of $72,159, with a diverse income distribution. About 33.8% of households earn less than $50,000, while 34.4% earn over $100,000. This suggests varying levels of sensitivity to transportation costs across the community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $38,718, residents have moderate discretionary spending power. Higher sales taxes would impact all residents' purchasing power, particularly affecting the 33.8% of households earning below $50,000.",
    "accessibility": "The community shows mixed transportation patterns: 48.3% drive alone, 16% use transit, and 17.8% have no vehicle. Most households (45.6%) have one vehicle, suggesting a need to balance both transit and driving improvements.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies that balance moderate transit fares with improved service times, considering the significant transit-dependent population. 2. Considered the impact of sales tax on the large lower-income segment. 3. Selected policies that provide reasonable driving fees to fund transit improvements without overly burdening the 48.3% who drive. 4. Focused on options that reduce transit travel times to benefit the 16% transit users and potentially attract more riders. 5. Chose policies that maintain reasonable costs for both modes while improving overall service quality."
