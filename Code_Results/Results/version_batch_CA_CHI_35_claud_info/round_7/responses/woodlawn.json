    "disposable_income": "Woodlawn has relatively low income levels with median income of $29,969 and 44.5% households earning less than $25,000. This suggests high sensitivity to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially for basic necessities.",
    "accessibility": "38.1% of households have no vehicle, and 24.3% use transit for commuting. The community heavily relies on both public transit and driving (45.4% drive alone), suggesting need for balanced transportation options.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares ($0.75) given high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Favor lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending. 3. Consider moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs manageable for both transit users and drivers."
