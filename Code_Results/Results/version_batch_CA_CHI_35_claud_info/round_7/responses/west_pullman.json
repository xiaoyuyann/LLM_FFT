    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has relatively low income levels with median income of $46,861 and 52.3% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households and per capita income of $24,916, residents likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Additional taxes and fees would significantly impact their consumption ability.",
    "accessibility": "23.4% households have no vehicle, making transit essential. However, 63.1% drive alone and 12.7% carpool, indicating car dependency. Only 12% use transit, suggesting possible transit access limitations.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares ($0.75) due to high percentage of low-income residents and car-less households. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening majority car users. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on residents. 5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs affordable."
