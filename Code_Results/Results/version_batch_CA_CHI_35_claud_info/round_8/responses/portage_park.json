    "disposable_income": "Portage Park has a median household income of $85,473, with about 30.8% of households earning less than $50,000. The community has moderate disposable income, suggesting sensitivity to both transit fares and driving costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a mix of income levels and an average household size of 2.8, discretionary spending capacity varies. Higher sales taxes would impact all residents, particularly the 30.8% lower-income households who have limited discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "89.9% of households own at least one vehicle, with 62.9% driving alone to work. 14% use transit, suggesting good access to both modes. Mean commute time is 37.1 minutes, indicating room for improvement in transportation efficiency.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals balancing moderate tax rates with improved transit service given mixed-income population. 2. Consider high car ownership but significant transit usage suggests need for maintaining both modes. 3. Focus on reducing commute times while keeping costs reasonable. 4. Selected proposals that maintain affordable transit fares given 14% transit ridership. 5. Moderate driving fees to improve transit without overly burdening majority car-dependent population."
