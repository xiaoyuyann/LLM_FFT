    "disposable_income": "Median income is $54,139, with 45.5% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.3, discretionary spending is likely constrained. 24% of households earn less than $25,000, indicating many families have minimal discretionary funds after essential expenses.",
    "accessibility": "23.6% of households have no vehicle, and 24.1% use transit for commuting. With 48.2% having only one vehicle, many residents rely on mixed transportation modes. Good transit access is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) due to significant transit dependency and lower incomes. 2. Prefer moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Choose lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Consider high transit usage (24.1%) and no-vehicle households (23.6%)."
