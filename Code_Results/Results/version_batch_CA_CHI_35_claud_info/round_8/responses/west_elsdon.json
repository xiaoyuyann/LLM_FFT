    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon has a median household income of $64,441, with 40.5% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. The per capita income of $27,703 suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 3.3, many families likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets, especially for the 40.5% lower-income households",
    "accessibility": "76.1% of residents drive (59.6% alone, 16.5% carpool), while 12.9% use transit. 86.5% of households own at least one vehicle, indicating high car dependency. The mean commute time of 36.3 minutes suggests significant transportation needs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary income for predominantly working-class families. 2. Balance transit fares and driving fees to maintain affordability while improving service. 3. Consider high car dependency while ensuring transit remains viable for 12.9% transit users. 4. Select proposals that reduce commute times without excessive cost burden. 5. Favor proposals that maintain driving affordability while moderately improving transit service"
