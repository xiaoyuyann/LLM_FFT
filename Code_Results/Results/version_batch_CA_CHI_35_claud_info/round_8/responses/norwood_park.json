    "disposable_income": "Norwood Park is relatively affluent with median household income of $107,122 and per capita income of $49,303. About 53.4% of households earn over $100,000 annually, suggesting significant disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher incomes, residents have substantial discretionary spending power. The impact of sales tax (0.5-1.5%) would be noticeable but manageable given the income levels. Most households can afford vehicle-related expenses, as shown by 92.3% having at least one car",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with 71.1% driving alone to work and only 7.3% using transit. High car ownership (56.8% having 2+ vehicles) suggests good road access is crucial. Transit usage is low but should be maintained as an option for the 7.7% without vehicles",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, prefer policies with lower driving fees and reasonable travel times. 2. Can tolerate moderate sales tax given income levels. 3. Higher transit fares acceptable since few use transit and incomes can support it. 4. Balance needed between maintaining car convenience and supporting basic transit service. 5. Prioritize options that minimize congestion given high car usage"
