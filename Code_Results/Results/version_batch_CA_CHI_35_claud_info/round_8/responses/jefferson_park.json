    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park has a relatively high median household income of $90,740, with 44.1% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher incomes and an average household size of 2.5, residents likely have significant discretionary spending. However, about 27% earn under $50,000 annually, so cost sensitivity varies across the population.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good car access (90.2% of households have at least one vehicle) and transit options (13.4% use transit for commuting). 61.7% drive alone to work, suggesting strong preference for driving despite transit availability.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies that balance driving efficiency with moderate fees, given high car dependency. 2. Considered moderate tax rates to maintain transit service without excessive burden. 3. Favored proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping fares reasonable. 4. Selected options that provide meaningful travel time improvements without extreme cost increases. 5. Accounted for mixed-income population by avoiding highest-cost combinations."
