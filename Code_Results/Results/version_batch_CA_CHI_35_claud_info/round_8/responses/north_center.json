    "disposable_income": "North Center is an affluent area with median income of $148,585 and 67.4% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can absorb moderate increases in transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($88,926), residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would affect this but not severely given the wealth levels",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transportation mix - 38.6% drive alone, 20% use transit, and 29.2% work from home. 87.4% of households own at least one car, showing good mobility options. This suggests residents can flexibly choose between driving and transit based on cost/time tradeoffs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost savings. 2. With significant transit usage, favor policies that improve transit times. 3. With high car ownership, moderate driving fees are acceptable if they reduce congestion. 4. Higher sales tax is tolerable given high discretionary spending. 5. Selected policies that balance car and transit improvements given mixed modal split. Ranked based on best overall time savings for both modes while keeping cost increases moderate"
