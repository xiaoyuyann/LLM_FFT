    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $69,810, with about 37.7% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests moderate disposable income but significant population segment that may be price-sensitive to transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.4, many families likely have limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets, especially for lower-income residents",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transportation profile with 43.8% driving alone, 24.5% using transit, and significant car-free population (23.8% no vehicle). Good balance of transit and driving needs to be maintained",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending power. 2. Balanced fare structure considering significant transit usage. 3. Moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time to benefit the quarter of population using transit. 5. Considered the large portion (23.8%) of no-vehicle households needing affordable transit options"
