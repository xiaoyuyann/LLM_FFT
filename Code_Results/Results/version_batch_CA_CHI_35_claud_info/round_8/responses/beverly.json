    "disposable_income": "Beverly is an affluent community with median income of $131,170 and 64.5% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can absorb moderate increases in transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high income levels, residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would affect this spending, but impact would be manageable given the wealth levels. Annual consumption likely averages $50,000+ per household",
    "accessibility": "Car ownership is very high (96.3% have at least one vehicle) and 62% drive alone to work. However, 17% use transit, suggesting decent transit access. The community needs balanced policies that maintain both driving and transit efficiency",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals that balance driving efficiency with transit improvements given high car ownership but significant transit use. 2. Community can handle moderate fee increases given high incomes. 3. Preferred lower sales tax options (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending. 4. Sought proposals reducing both car and transit travel times. 5. Selected options with moderate rather than extreme fare/fee combinations"
