    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side has relatively high income levels with 43.7% of households earning over $150,000 and a median household income of $124,558. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can generally absorb higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($94,087), residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would impact this, but the community can likely handle moderate increases given the wealth levels",
    "accessibility": "The area has diverse transportation usage: 41.9% drive alone, 22.7% use transit, and 22.7% work from home. Most households (60.6%) have 1 vehicle, while 22.4% have no vehicle. This suggests need for both efficient driving and transit options",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost savings. 2. Balance needs of both drivers and transit users given mixed mode share. 3. Support policies that reduce congestion given urban location. 4. Can accept moderate tax increases given income levels. 5. Prefer policies that significantly improve transit times while maintaining reasonable driving times. Selected proposals that offer best overall time savings with moderate cost increases, particularly benefiting both modes"
