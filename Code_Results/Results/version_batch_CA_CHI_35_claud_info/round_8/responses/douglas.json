    "disposable_income": "Douglas has a relatively low median income of $43,528, with 54.3% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially considering 34.8% earn less than $25,000 annually.",
    "accessibility": "44.4% of households have no vehicle, and 26.4% use transit for commuting. The community heavily relies on public transportation, with relatively high transit usage and walking/biking (8.4%). The mean commute time is 31.8 minutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low incomes\n2. Favor lower sales tax rates to protect limited discretionary spending\n3. Support moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening the 40.3% who drive alone\n4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on low-income residents\n5. Consider policies that reduce transit travel time while keeping fares affordable"
