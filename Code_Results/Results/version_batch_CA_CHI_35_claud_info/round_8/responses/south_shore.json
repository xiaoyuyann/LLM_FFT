    "disposable_income": "South Shore has relatively low income levels with median income of $39,649 and 56.5% of households making less than $50,000. This suggests high sensitivity to costs from fares, fees, and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower income levels and high percentage of households below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely limited. Additional transportation costs and sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "High transit dependency with 37.8% having no vehicle and 32.8% using transit for commuting. 49.8% drive alone showing mixed transportation needs. Good balance of transit and driving infrastructure needed",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) given high transit usage and lower incomes. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements for both transit and driving. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times from current 58.8 minutes while keeping costs manageable"
