    "disposable_income": "West Englewood is a low-income community with median income of $29,234, significantly below Chicago's average. 69.5% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, with 42.1% earning less than $25,000, indicating very limited disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact their ability to afford basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "32.7% of households have no vehicle, and 25.9% rely on transit for commuting. The community has high transit dependency despite having limited transit access. 55.6% drive alone, suggesting a need to balance both transit and driving costs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lowest sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help transit-dependent residents. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce both transit and driving times while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents"
