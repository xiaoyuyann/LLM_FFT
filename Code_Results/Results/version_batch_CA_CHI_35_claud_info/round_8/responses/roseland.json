    "disposable_income": "Roseland has relatively low income levels with median income of $49,808 and 50.1% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs and sales tax increases would significantly impact discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 26.3% households earning less than $25,000 and a per capita income of $24,754, discretionary consumption is limited. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of household budgets, making lower fares and fees preferable.",
    "accessibility": "25.9% of households have no vehicle, and 20.1% use transit for work commutes. Good transit service is essential. 53.9% drive alone, so driving costs also impact many residents. Current transit times (58.8 min) are much higher than driving (21 min), indicating need for transit improvements.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income residents and car-less households\n2. Balanced moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers\n3. Favored lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to preserve disposable income\n4. Selected options that reduce transit travel times to under 55 minutes\n5. Considered combined impact on both transit users and drivers given mixed mode usage"
