    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has relatively low income levels with median income of $46,861 and 52.3% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households and per capita income of $24,916, residents likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Additional taxes or fees would significantly impact their consumption ability.",
    "accessibility": "23.4% households have no vehicle, making transit essential. However, current transit usage is only 12% while 63.1% drive alone, suggesting possible transit service gaps. Travel times show significant disparity between car (21 min) and transit (58.8 min).",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) given income constraints and car-less households. 2. Favored lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to preserve discretionary spending. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening majority who drive. 4. Sought balance between transit improvement and cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents."
