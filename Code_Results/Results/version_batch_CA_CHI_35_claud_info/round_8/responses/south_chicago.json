    "disposable_income": "South Chicago is a lower-income community with median income of $43,936, significantly below Chicago's average. About 55.6% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, indicating limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households and average household size of 2.7, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "31.6% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% rely on transit for commuting. While 58.2% drive alone, the high no-vehicle rate suggests transit accessibility is crucial. The community needs balanced policies that maintain affordable transit while improving service",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) given the high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending power. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) were preferred over high fees ($1.00) to balance revenue needs with affordability for driving households. 4. Selected proposals that showed significant transit time improvements while keeping costs manageable. 5. Considered the large population (31.6%) with no vehicles who depend entirely on transit"
