    "disposable_income": "Kenwood shows significant income diversity with 45% making under $50k and 33.2% making over $100k. Median income is $58,052, suggesting moderate disposable income but with many residents sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 1.8, many households have limited discretionary spending power. Higher taxes and fees would impact the 45% lower-income residents significantly",
    "accessibility": "33.1% have no vehicle, 50.3% have one vehicle. Transit usage (23.1%) equals drive-alone (40.1%), indicating strong reliance on both modes. Good transit access is crucial for this mixed-mode community",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help car-less residents (33.1%) and current transit users (23.1%). 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) balances revenue needs with impact on discretionary spending. 3. Include some driving fees to improve transit service without excessive burden. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time to support high transit usage. 5. Consider mixed income levels - avoid highest combined costs"
