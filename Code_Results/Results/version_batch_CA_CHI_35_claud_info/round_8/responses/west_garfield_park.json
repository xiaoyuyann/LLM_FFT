    "disposable_income": "The community has relatively low income levels with 42.2% households earning less than $25,000 and median income of $36,360. This suggests high sensitivity to any additional transportation costs or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($18,503), residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact their ability to purchase other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "38.7% of households have no vehicle available, and 27.9% rely on transit for commuting. The mean commute time is 36.1 minutes, indicating significant dependence on public transportation despite longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) due to high transit dependency and low income levels. 2. Favor lower sales tax (0.5%) to preserve purchasing power. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without excessive burden. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts. 5. Consider high proportion of both transit users and drivers in the community."
