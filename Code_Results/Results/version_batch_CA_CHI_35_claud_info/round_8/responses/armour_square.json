    "disposable_income": "Armour Square has relatively low income levels with 50.8% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests high sensitivity to cost increases from taxes, fares, and fees",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely limited. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "The area has high transit dependency (33.9% no vehicle households) and significant transit usage (24.4%). While 41.1% drive alone, the large Asian population (71.7%) and lower-income residents rely heavily on public transit",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Moderate driving fees acceptable since 33.9% have no cars. 3. Lower sales tax preferred due to limited discretionary spending. 4. Balance between transit service improvements and cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping fares affordable"
