    "disposable_income": "Archer Heights has a mixed income profile with 46.3% households earning less than $50,000 annually, indicating significant budget constraints for many residents. About 29.5% earn over $100,000, suggesting some economic diversity",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high percentage of lower-income households, many residents would be sensitive to increased transportation costs and sales tax. The average household size of 3.1 suggests multiple dependents and higher household expenses",
    "accessibility": "76.4% of households own at least one vehicle, with drive-alone (58.7%) and carpooling (19.4%) being dominant commute modes. Transit usage is moderate at 13.1%, while 23.7% have no vehicle access, indicating need for reliable transit options",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending for lower-income households. 2. Balance transit fares around $1.25 to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable for no-vehicle households. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening the majority who drive. 4. Consider proposals that reduce both transit and driving times to benefit all commuters. 5. Avoid highest tax/fee combinations due to large lower-income population"
