    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch has a median income of $58,647, with 45.6% households earning less than $50,000. The community has moderate disposable income, making residents sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and household sizes, discretionary spending is limited for many residents. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially for the 27.6% earning less than $25,000",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars (65.2% drive alone) with limited transit usage (10.8%). High car ownership (87.4% have at least one vehicle) suggests car-dependent infrastructure and lifestyle",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Given high car dependency, avoid highest driving fees. 3. Balance transit improvements with moderate fares to benefit the 10.8% transit users. 4. Consider proposals that reduce car travel time without excessive cost burden. 5. Select options that maintain reasonable transit times for lower-income residents who depend on it"
