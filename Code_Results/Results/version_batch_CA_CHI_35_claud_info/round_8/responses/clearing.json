    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, prefer policies with lower driving fees. 2. Lower sales tax preferred due to mixed income levels. 3. Higher transit fares acceptable since few use transit. 4. Focus on reducing car travel times since majority drive. 5. Balance between maintaining car accessibility while gradually improving transit service. Selected policies that minimize impact on driving costs while maintaining reasonable transit improvements."
