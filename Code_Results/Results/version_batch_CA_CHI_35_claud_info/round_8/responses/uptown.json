    "disposable_income": "Mixed income levels with 38.6% earning under $50k and 31% earning over $100k. Median income of $66,871 suggests moderate disposable income, but significant income disparity exists",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high percentage of lower-income households (23.2% under $25k) and high cost of living in Chicago, many residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would particularly impact these households",
    "accessibility": "Strong transit orientation with 34.9% using transit for work commute. 42.1% of households have no vehicle, indicating high transit dependency. Good existing transit access with multiple L lines and bus routes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending power of large lower-income population. 2. Favored moderate transit fares ($1.25) to balance transit agency funding with affordability. 3. Supported driving fees to improve transit service while managing congestion. 4. Focused on proposals that reduce transit travel times given high transit dependency. 5. Considered balance of car vs transit times given mixed-mode usage in community"
