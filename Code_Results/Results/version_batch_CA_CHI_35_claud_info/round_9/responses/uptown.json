    "disposable_income": "Mixed income levels with 38.6% earning under $50k and 31% earning over $100k. Median income of $66,871 suggests moderate disposable income, but significant income disparity exists",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high percentage of lower-income households (23.2% under $25k), many residents are sensitive to additional taxes and fees. Higher-income households have more flexibility with transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "Strong transit usage (34.9% commute by transit) and high percentage of car-free households (42.1%). Good transit access with multiple bus and rail options. Only 32.5% drive alone to work",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to high transit dependency and lower-income population\n2. Moderate tax rates to balance service improvements with cost burden\n3. Support driving fees to fund transit while affecting minority of residents who drive\n4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time\n5. Consider proposals that maintain reasonable car travel times for mixed-mode households"
