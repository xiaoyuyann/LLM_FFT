    "disposable_income": "Mixed-income community with 43.5% making $100k+ but also 32.6% under $50k. About 15.6% are low-income (<$25k), suggesting sensitivity to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many households have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity, but a significant portion may be cost-sensitive to additional taxes and fees",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transportation needs - 19.8% no vehicle, 48.2% one vehicle. 49.7% drive alone, 21.5% use transit, indicating need for both car and transit options. Good balance of transportation modes suggests flexibility",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals balancing moderate taxes with improved transit times given mixed-income population. 2. Consider high transit usage (21.5%) and no-vehicle households (19.8%). 3. Account for significant driving population (49.7%) by avoiding highest driving fees. 4. Choose policies that reduce transit times without excessive cost burden. 5. Selected proposals 13, 4, 10, 21, and 19 as they offer good transit time improvements with moderate cost increases, serving both transit users and drivers"
