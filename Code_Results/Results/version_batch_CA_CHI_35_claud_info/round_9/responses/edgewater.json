    "disposable_income": "Edgewater has a median income of $67,796, with a diverse income distribution. About 38% earn less than $50,000, while 32.9% earn over $100,000. This suggests a need to balance policy costs across different income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a per capita income of $51,717, residents have moderate discretionary spending power. Higher sales taxes would impact all residents, particularly affecting the 38% lower-income households who have less flexible spending.",
    "accessibility": "The community shows balanced transit (33.2%) and driving (33%) usage for commuting, with 38.8% households having no vehicle. The area needs policies that maintain both transit and driving accessibility while keeping costs reasonable.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with moderate tax rates to balance revenue needs and household impact. 2. Favored proposals with lower transit fares due to high transit usage and no-vehicle households. 3. Supported moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Considered travel time improvements for both modes given the equal modal split. 5. Selected policies that provide best overall accessibility while maintaining affordability for diverse income levels."
