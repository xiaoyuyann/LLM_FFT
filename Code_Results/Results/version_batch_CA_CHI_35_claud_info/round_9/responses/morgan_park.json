    "disposable_income": "Morgan Park has a mixed income profile with median income of $71,683. About 39.5% of households earn less than $50,000, while 34.7% earn over $100,000. This suggests careful consideration of fare and tax impacts across income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With per capita income of $39,283, residents have moderate discretionary spending power. Higher sales taxes would impact all residents, while transportation costs particularly affect the 39.5% lower-income households who are more price-sensitive.",
    "accessibility": "64.9% drive alone and 9.5% use transit for commuting. 88.7% of households have at least one vehicle, indicating high car dependency. However, transit access needs to be maintained for the 11.3% of households without vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending power across all income levels. 2. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening the car-dependent majority. 3. Keep transit fares moderate ($1.25) to balance system funding with affordability for transit-dependent residents. 4. Avoid highest driving fees given high car dependency. 5. Consider travel time improvements that benefit both drivers and transit users."
