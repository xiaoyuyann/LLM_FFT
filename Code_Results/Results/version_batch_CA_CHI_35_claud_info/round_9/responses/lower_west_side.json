    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $69,810, with about 37.7% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests moderate disposable income but significant population segment is budget-sensitive",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and cost of living in Chicago, many households have limited discretionary spending. Higher sales taxes would impact consumer spending power, especially for lower-income residents",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transportation profile with 43.8% driving alone, 24.5% using transit, and 23.8% no vehicle households. Good balance of transit and driving needs to be considered. Location provides decent access to downtown and other employment centers",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to support large transit-dependent population and no-vehicle households. 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) balances revenue needs with household budget impacts. 3. Include some driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Focus on options that reduce transit travel times to benefit working commuters. 5. Consider combined impact of fees on household budgets given income distribution"
