    "disposable_income": "Montclare has a median income of $69,038, with about 38.3% of households making less than $50,000 annually. This suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents somewhat sensitive to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.9, many families likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher taxes and fees would impact their consumption ability, especially for the 38.3% lower-income households.",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars with 87.3% of households owning at least one vehicle and 74.9% driving alone to work. Only 4.4% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility or convenience. The high car dependency makes driving costs particularly important.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) due to significant lower-income population. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening the car-dependent majority. 3. Selected lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage transit use. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Considered that most residents drive but should have affordable transit options."
