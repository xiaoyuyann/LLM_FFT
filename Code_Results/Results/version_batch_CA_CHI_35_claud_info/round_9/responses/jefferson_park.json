    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park has a relatively high median household income of $90,740, with 44.1% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher income levels, residents have significant discretionary spending power. However, about 27% earn under $50,000, so policy impacts on costs need to consider this segment. The 1.5% tax rate would impact annual consumption more significantly.",
    "accessibility": "The area shows high car dependency with 90.1% of households owning cars and 61.7% driving alone to work. Only 13.4% use transit despite having access to CTA Blue Line and Metra. This suggests policies should balance driving convenience while incentivizing transit use.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with moderate tax rates (1%) to balance revenue needs without excessive burden. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to encourage transit use without severely impacting majority car-dependent population. 3. Selected lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to incentivize transit adoption. 4. Considered travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transportation needs. 5. Balanced overall cost impact on different income segments of the community."
