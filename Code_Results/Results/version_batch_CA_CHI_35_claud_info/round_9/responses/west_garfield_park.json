    "disposable_income": "The community has relatively low income levels with 42.2% households earning less than $25,000 and median income of $36,360. This suggests high sensitivity to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($18,503) and high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "38.7% of households have no vehicle available, and 27.9% rely on transit for commuting. The mean commute time is 36.1 minutes, suggesting significant dependence on public transportation despite longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax. 2. Consider high transit dependency when evaluating service quality improvements. 3. Balance driving fees since 54% drive alone but many households have limited vehicle access. 4. Selected proposals 0, 9, 3, 18, 21 because they combine: a) Lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help transit-dependent residents b) Lower or moderate sales tax (0.5-1.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income c) No driving fees to avoid additional burden on working households with cars d) Reasonable improvements in transit service times compared to current conditions"
