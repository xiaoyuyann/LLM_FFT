    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is an affluent community with median household income of $139,046 and 63% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can absorb moderate increases in transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($70,693), residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would affect this but not severely given the wealth levels. Most households can afford multiple vehicles (62.3% own 2+ cars)",
    "accessibility": "The community is car-dependent with 68.1% driving (alone or carpool) to work, only 10.5% using transit, and 17.2% working from home. Good road access but limited transit usage suggests improving transit service could benefit the area",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and usage, policies that reduce car travel time while moderately increasing costs are acceptable. 2. Higher sales tax and driving fees are tolerable given high incomes. 3. Lower transit fares less critical due to low transit usage and high incomes. 4. Prioritize policies that significantly improve travel times for both modes. 5. Balance revenue generation for transit improvements with reasonable cost increases"
