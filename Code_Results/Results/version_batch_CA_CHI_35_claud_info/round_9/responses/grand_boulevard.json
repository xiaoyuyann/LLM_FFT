    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has relatively low income levels with 53.6% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. The median income of $43,048 suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households and 30.3% having no vehicle, residents likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Additional transportation costs or taxes would significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The community shows significant transit dependence with 21.4% using transit and 30.3% having no vehicle. However, 49.3% drive alone, indicating a mix of transportation needs. Good transit service is crucial for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) due to high proportion of low-income residents and transit users. 2. Moderate tax rate (1%) to maintain service quality without overly burdening low-income households. 3. Support some driving fees to improve transit service while considering the 49.3% who drive. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost burden. 5. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs affordable."
