    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch has a median income of $58,647, with 45.6% households earning less than $50,000. The community has moderate disposable income, making residents sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and household sizes, discretionary spending is limited for many residents. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially for the 27.6% earning less than $25,000",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars (65.2% drive alone) with limited transit usage (10.8%). High car ownership (87.4% have at least one vehicle) suggests car-dependent infrastructure and lifestyle",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) due to limited discretionary income. 2. Moderate driving fees ($0.5) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 3. Lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to support transit-dependent residents. 4. Balance between reducing congestion and maintaining affordable driving costs. 5. Consider proposals that reduce both transit and driving times without excessive cost burden"
