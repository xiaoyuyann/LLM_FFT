    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $51,105 and per capita income is $25,358, with 49% of households earning less than $50k annually. This indicates limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially considering 25% of households earn less than $25k annually.",
    "accessibility": "20.1% use transit for work commutes, 25% have no vehicles, and 40.8% have one vehicle. Mean commute time is 35.7 minutes. The community needs affordable and efficient transit options while balancing costs for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares and moderate tax rates due to limited household incomes. 2. Consider significant transit-dependent population (25% no vehicles). 3. Balance driving fees since 52.9% drive alone to work. 4. Focus on reducing transit travel times while keeping costs affordable. 5. Selected policies that offer best combination of reduced travel times and lower costs for both transit and car users, considering the mixed-mode transportation needs of the community."
