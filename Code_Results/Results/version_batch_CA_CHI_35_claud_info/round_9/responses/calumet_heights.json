    "disposable_income": "Median income is $68,436, with a diverse income distribution. About 36.7% earn less than $50,000, while 30.1% earn over $100,000. Per capita income of $39,867 suggests moderate disposable income levels",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution, many households have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes and transportation costs would significantly impact the 36.7% of households earning under $50,000",
    "accessibility": "19.4% have no vehicle, while 47.9% have one vehicle. Transit usage is significant at 19.5%, with 52.3% driving alone. The community needs balanced transportation options that don't overly burden either drivers or transit users",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to significant transit-dependent population. 2. Moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Keep sales tax moderate to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Consider the large working-class population that needs affordable transportation options"
