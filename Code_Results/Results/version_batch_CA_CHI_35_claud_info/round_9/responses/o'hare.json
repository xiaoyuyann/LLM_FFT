    "disposable_income": "Median income is $62,264, with about 37.5% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents somewhat sensitive to cost increases but not severely constrained.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.2, most households have moderate discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would impact consumption but not drastically for most residents.",
    "accessibility": "High car dependency with 91.3% households having at least one vehicle and 67.5% driving alone to work. Only 14.4% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility despite being near O'Hare airport. Current transit times are significantly higher than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and driving preference, policies that reduce driving times without excessive fees are prioritized. 2. Moderate transit usage suggests some demand for improved service, but not at high costs. 3. Middle-income demographics indicate preference for balanced cost approaches. 4. Lower sales tax options preferred due to impact on discretionary spending. 5. Selected policies that offer best driving time improvements while keeping combined costs (tax + fees) moderate."
