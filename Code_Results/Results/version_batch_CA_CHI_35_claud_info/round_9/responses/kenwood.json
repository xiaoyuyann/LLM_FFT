    "disposable_income": "Kenwood shows significant income diversity with 45% making under $50K and 33.2% making over $100K. Median income is $58,052, suggesting moderate disposable income but with notable disparities. Many residents would be sensitive to cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and household sizes, discretionary spending varies widely. Higher sales taxes would impact both low and middle-income households significantly, especially the 27.4% making under $25K.",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transportation needs: 33.1% have no vehicle, 50.3% have one vehicle. Transit usage is significant at 23.1%, while 40.1% drive alone. Good balance of transit and driving needs to consider.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to benefit the third of residents without vehicles and 23.1% transit users. 2. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Keep sales tax at 1% or lower to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Consider policies that reduce both transit and driving times while maintaining affordability."
