    "disposable_income": "Pullman has a median income of $54,755, with 45.8% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.1, discretionary spending is likely constrained. About 22.7% of households earn less than $25,000, indicating many residents need to carefully budget transportation expenses.",
    "accessibility": "64% drive alone to work, 17.6% use transit, and 16.1% have no vehicle. The community needs balanced policies that don't overly burden drivers while improving transit service for those dependent on it.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Balance transit fares around $1.25 to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without excessive burden on majority who drive. 4. Consider travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transportation needs. 5. Avoid highest combined cost options given income constraints."
