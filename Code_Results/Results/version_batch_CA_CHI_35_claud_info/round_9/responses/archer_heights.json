    "disposable_income": "Mixed-income community with 46.3% households earning under $50k, indicating significant budget constraints for many residents. About 29.5% earn over $100k, showing income diversity",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity for nearly half the population. Higher sales taxes and transportation costs would significantly impact lower-income households' purchasing power",
    "accessibility": "76.3% of households have at least one vehicle, with high drive-alone (58.7%) and carpool (19.4%) rates. Transit usage is moderate at 13.1%, suggesting some transit dependency but primarily car-oriented community",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) due to large lower-income population. 2. Balance moderate transit fares ($1.25) to maintain service quality while keeping costs accessible. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4. Consider high car ownership and usage rates when evaluating driving costs. 5. Factor in significant Hispanic population who may have varied transportation needs and economic considerations. Selected proposals balance accessibility for transit-dependent residents while not overly burdening the majority who drive"
