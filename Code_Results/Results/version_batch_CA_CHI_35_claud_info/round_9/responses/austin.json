    "disposable_income": "Austin has relatively low income levels with a median household income of $40,086 and 57.6% of households earning less than $50,000. This suggests high sensitivity to cost increases from taxes, fares, and fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high poverty rates and low per capita income ($23,403), residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Any increase in transportation costs would significantly impact their ability to afford other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "30.6% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% rely on transit for work commutes. The mean commute time is 37.1 minutes, indicating significant dependence on public transportation despite longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help the large transit-dependent population. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited disposable income. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent workers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to help the significant transit-using population."
