    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $61,898, which is moderate. 41.8% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, suggesting many families need to be cost-conscious. The per capita income of $25,646 indicates limited discretionary spending power.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a large Hispanic population (86.8%) and average household size of 3.2, many families likely have significant essential expenses for basic needs. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets meaningfully given the income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Car-dependent community with 90.5% of households having at least one vehicle. 68.4% drive alone to work, while only 7.7% use transit. Mean commute time is 36.4 minutes, suggesting significant travel needs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect household purchasing power. 2. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) acceptable since most residents drive and fees could improve transit. 3. Lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) preferred to keep transit affordable for the 7.7% transit users. 4. Balance between driving costs and transit improvements needed since community is car-dependent. 5. Focus on options that reduce commute times without excessive cost burden."
