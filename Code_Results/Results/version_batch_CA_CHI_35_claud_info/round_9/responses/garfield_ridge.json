    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge has a relatively high median income of $90,374, with 46% of households earning over $100,000. However, about 30% earn less than $50,000, indicating income diversity that needs consideration",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher median income, many residents have moderate to high discretionary spending power. However, the 30% lower-income households would be more sensitive to increased taxes and fees",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with 92% of households owning cars and 71.2% driving alone to work. Only 7.6% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility or convenience. 7.9% have no vehicle access",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, prefer policies with lower driving fees to avoid excessive burden on majority. 2. Since most residents have higher incomes, can accept moderate sales tax to improve transit. 3. Given low transit usage, prefer lower fares to encourage adoption. 4. Balance needed between car convenience and transit improvement. 5. Consider policies that reduce travel times for both modes without excessive cost burden"
