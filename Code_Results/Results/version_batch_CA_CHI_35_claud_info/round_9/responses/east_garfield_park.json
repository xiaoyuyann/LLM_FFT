    "disposable_income": "The community has relatively low income levels with 65.4% of households earning less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $31,762. This suggests high sensitivity to any additional transportation costs or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($20,343) and high poverty rates, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact their ability to purchase other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "40% of households have no vehicle, and 25% rely on public transit for commuting. The mean commute time is 35.1 minutes, suggesting significant dependence on public transportation. The community needs affordable and efficient transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) due to low income levels and high transit dependency. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance between reducing transit travel time and keeping costs affordable. 5. Consider high percentage of car-free households and transit users."
