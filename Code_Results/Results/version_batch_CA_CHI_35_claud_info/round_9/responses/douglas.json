    "disposable_income": "Douglas has a relatively low median income of $43,528, with 54.3% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially considering 34.8% earn less than $25,000 annually.",
    "accessibility": "44.4% of households have no vehicle, and 26.4% use transit for commuting. The community heavily relies on public transportation, with relatively high transit usage and walking/biking (8.4%). The mean commute time is 31.8 minutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares due to high transit dependency and low income levels. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates to protect discretionary spending power. 3. Supported moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car owners. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost considerations. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping fares affordable."
