    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a relatively wealthy area with 61.3% of households earning over $100,000 annually. However, there is income diversity with about 20% earning under $50,000. This suggests most residents can absorb higher transportation costs, but policies should not overly burden lower-income residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high income levels, residents likely have significant discretionary spending. The 1-1.5% sales tax impact would be notable given high consumption levels, but manageable for most. The area has high retail density, so residents likely spend considerably on taxable goods.",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent transit access and walkability, with only 22.7% driving. 50.5% of households don't own cars, and 47.9% use transit or walk/bike. The area is a transit hub with multiple L lines and bus routes, making transit improvements particularly impactful.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize policies that improve transit times given high transit usage. 2. Can accept moderate fare increases since income levels are high. 3. Support driving fees to reduce congestion and fund transit, as most residents don't drive. 4. Balance tax rates considering high discretionary spending. 5. Selected policies that provide best transit time improvements while maintaining reasonable costs. Ranked proposals that combine moderate-to-high driving fees with moderate transit fares and taxes, as these optimize transit performance without excessive cost burden."
