    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $51,105 and per capita income is $25,358, with 49% of households earning less than $50k annually. This indicates limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially for the 25% earning less than $25k annually.",
    "accessibility": "25% of households have no vehicle, and 20.1% use transit for work commutes. Mean commute time is 35.7 minutes. The community relies on both private vehicles (52.9% drive alone) and public transit, suggesting need for balanced policy.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high percentage of transit-dependent and low-income residents. 2. Moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Keep sales tax moderate to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden. 5. Consider policies that reduce travel times for both modes given long average commute times."
