    "disposable_income": "The community has relatively low income levels with 42.2% households earning less than $25,000 and median income of $36,360. This suggests high sensitivity to any additional transportation costs or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($18,503) and high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Additional transportation costs would significantly impact other essential spending.",
    "accessibility": "38.7% of households have no vehicle available, and 27.9% rely on transit for commuting. The mean commute time is 36.1 minutes, suggesting significant dependence on public transportation despite longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and taxes. 2. Consider high transit dependency requires maintaining/improving transit service. 3. Lower driving fees preferred as 54% drive alone and many households have limited income. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on residents. 5. Selected proposals that minimize combined impact of taxes, fares, and fees while maintaining reasonable transit service."
