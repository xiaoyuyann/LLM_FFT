    "disposable_income": "North Center is an affluent area with median income of $148,585 and 67.4% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can generally absorb higher transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($88,926), residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would impact this but may be tolerable given the wealth levels. Annual consumption is likely high, making sales tax a meaningful consideration",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transportation mix - 38.6% drive alone, 20% use transit, and 29.2% work from home. 87.4% of households have at least one vehicle, showing car dependency, but transit usage is significant. This suggests residents value both driving and transit options",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost savings. 2. Consider balance between driving and transit improvements since both are heavily used. 3. Higher sales tax is acceptable if it improves service significantly. 4. Moderate driving fees can help fund transit without excessive burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce both driving and transit times while keeping costs reasonable for mixed-mode community"
