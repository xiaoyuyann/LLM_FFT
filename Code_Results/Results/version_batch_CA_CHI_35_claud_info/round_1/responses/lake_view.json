    "disposable_income": "Lake View is a relatively affluent area with median income of $100,625 and 50.2% of households making over $100,000. This suggests residents have higher disposable income and can better absorb transportation costs compared to other areas.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($87,044), residents likely have significant discretionary spending. The 1-1.5% sales tax impact would be notable given higher consumption levels, but not severely restrictive for most residents.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit access with 36.9% using transit for commuting. 39.6% of households don't own vehicles, indicating strong transit dependency. However, 24.8% drive alone, suggesting need to balance both modes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high transit usage and car-free households, prioritized proposals that improve transit times while keeping fares moderate. 2. Higher driving fees acceptable given affluence and lower car ownership. 3. Moderate sales tax preferred to balance revenue needs with consumption impact. 4. Proposals with best transit time improvements ranked higher. 5. Balanced approach considering both transit and driving needs given mixed modal split."
