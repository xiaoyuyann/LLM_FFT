    "disposable_income": "Mixed-income community with 46.3% households earning under $50k, indicating significant budget constraints for many residents. About 29.5% earn over $100k, showing income diversity",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity for nearly half the population, making them sensitive to both fare increases and sales tax changes. Higher sales tax would particularly impact the large lower-income segment",
    "accessibility": "High car dependency with 76.4% owning at least one vehicle and 78.1% using cars for commuting. However, significant transit-dependent population (23.7% no vehicle) and 13.1% using transit",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) due to large lower-income population. 2. Balance moderate transit fares ($1.25) to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent majority. 4. Consider policies that reduce transit travel time to benefit transit-dependent population. 5. Avoid highest tax/fee combinations due to significant low-income population"
