    "disposable_income": "Englewood has very limited disposable income with 46.5% households earning less than $25,000 and median income of $27,792, which is significantly below Chicago's average. Any additional transportation costs would have a major impact on household budgets.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, discretionary spending is minimal. Higher sales taxes would disproportionately affect basic necessities. The community needs to preserve as much income as possible for essential needs.",
    "accessibility": "44.6% of households have no vehicle, making transit accessibility crucial. 25.2% use transit for commuting while 51% drive alone. The community needs affordable transit options while maintaining reasonable driving costs for those who depend on cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lowest tax rate (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited disposable income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help transit-dependent residents. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time from current 58.8 minutes."
