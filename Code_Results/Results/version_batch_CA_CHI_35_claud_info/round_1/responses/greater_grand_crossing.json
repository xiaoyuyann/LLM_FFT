    "disposable_income": "The community has relatively low income levels with 58.6% of households earning less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $39,908. This suggests limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets and consumption abilities.",
    "accessibility": "36.5% of households have no vehicle, and 29.5% rely on transit for commuting. Combined with 52.5% who drive alone, the community needs both affordable transit and reasonable driving costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) and lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to maintain affordability. 2. Consider moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Balance between transit time improvements and cost impacts. 4. Avoid highest tax rate (1.5%) due to impact on limited discretionary income. 5. Proposals should serve both transit-dependent and driving populations."
