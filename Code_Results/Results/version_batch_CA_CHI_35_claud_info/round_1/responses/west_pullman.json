    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has relatively low income levels with median income of $46,861 and 52.3% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households and per capita income of $24,916, residents likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Additional taxes or fees would significantly impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "23.4% households have no vehicle, making transit essential. However, only 12% use transit while 75.8% drive/carpool, suggesting limited transit service quality. Current transit travel times are significantly higher than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) given income constraints and car-less households. 2. Favored lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening majority who drive. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time from current 58.8 minutes while keeping costs affordable."
