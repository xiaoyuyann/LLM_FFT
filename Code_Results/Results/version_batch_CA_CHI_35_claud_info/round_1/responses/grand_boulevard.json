    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a relatively low median income of $43,048, with 53.6% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 35.5% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially for essential purchases.",
    "accessibility": "30.3% of households have no vehicle, and 21.4% use transit for commuting. The community has significant transit dependency, while 49.3% drive alone, indicating a mixed-mode transportation profile.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Keep sales tax moderate to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Consider the large proportion of both transit users and drivers in the community."
