    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park has a relatively high median household income of $90,740, with 44.1% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher incomes and an average household size of 2.5, residents likely have significant discretionary spending. However, about 27% earn under $50,000 annually, so cost sensitivity varies across the community.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good car access (90.2% of households have at least one vehicle) and transit options (13.4% use transit for commuting). 61.7% drive alone to work, suggesting strong preference for driving despite transit availability.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with moderate tax rates (1%) to balance transit funding and household tax burden. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion while not overly burdening the car-dependent majority. 3. Selected lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage transit use while considering lower-income residents. 4. Focused on proposals that reduce both car and transit travel times. 5. Balanced the community's car-centric nature with the need to improve transit service."
