    "disposable_income": "South Chicago is a lower-income community with median income of $43,936, significantly below Chicago's average. About 55.6% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, indicating limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets and reduce spending on other essential needs",
    "accessibility": "31.6% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% rely on transit for commuting. While 58.2% drive alone, the high proportion of transit-dependent residents suggests need for affordable and efficient public transit",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents\n2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited disposable income\n3. Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers\n4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts\n5. Considered high proportion of both transit users and drivers in community"
