    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge has a relatively high median income of $90,374, with 46% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher income levels, residents have significant discretionary spending power. However, the community needs to balance transportation costs with other expenses, considering that about 30% of households earn less than $50,000.",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars, with 92.2% of households owning at least one vehicle and 71.2% driving alone to work. Only 7.6% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility or preference for driving. The high car ownership indicates good road infrastructure but potential congestion issues.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, prefer policies with lower driving fees but still support transit improvements. 2. Can accept moderate tax increases due to higher income levels. 3. Prefer balanced fare options to maintain transit affordability. 4. Focus on reducing car travel times due to high driving population. 5. Consider policies that improve transit times without excessive costs to drivers."
