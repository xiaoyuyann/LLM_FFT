    "disposable_income": "Norwood Park is relatively affluent with median household income of $107,122 and per capita income of $49,303. About 53.4% of households earn over $100,000 annually, suggesting significant disposable income",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher incomes, residents have substantial discretionary spending power. The impact of sales tax (0.5-1.5%) would be noticeable but manageable given the income levels. Most households can afford vehicle-related expenses, as shown by 92.3% having at least one car",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with 71.1% driving alone to work and only 7.3% using transit. High car ownership (56.8% having 2+ vehicles) suggests good road access is crucial. Transit usage is low but should be maintained for the 7.7% of households without vehicles",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, prefer policies with lower driving fees but reasonable transit service. 2. Higher income means moderate sales tax is acceptable if it improves overall transportation. 3. Focus on reducing car travel times since majority drive. 4. Maintain reasonable transit fares for lower-income residents. 5. Balance between minimizing costs for drivers while maintaining transit quality"
