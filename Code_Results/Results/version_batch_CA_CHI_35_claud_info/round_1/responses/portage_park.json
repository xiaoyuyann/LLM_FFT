    "discretionary_consumption": "With per capita income of $38,488, residents have moderate discretionary spending power. Higher sales taxes would impact household budgets, especially for the 30.8% lower-income households. The community needs to balance transportation costs with other essential expenses.",

    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and driving rates, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve transit. 2. With moderate income levels, avoid highest tax/fare combinations. 3. Prioritize policies that reduce overall travel times while keeping costs reasonable. 4. Consider the 14% transit users and 10.1% car-less households needing affordable transit. 5. Balance between driving efficiency and transit improvement given the mixed-mode usage."
