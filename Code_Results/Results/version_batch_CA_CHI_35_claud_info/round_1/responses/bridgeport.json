    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a median household income of $72,159, with a diverse income distribution. About 33.8% of households earn less than $50,000, while 34.4% earn over $100,000. This suggests varying levels of sensitivity to transportation costs across the community.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.4, many residents have moderate discretionary spending power. Higher sales taxes would impact all residents, but particularly the 33.8% of households earning below $50,000 who have less flexible budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The community shows mixed transportation patterns: 48.3% drive alone, 16% use transit, and 17.8% have no vehicle. With 45.6% having one vehicle and 36.6% having multiple vehicles, policies affecting both driving and transit costs will impact most residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposal 10 as it balances moderate tax (1.0%), low transit fare ($0.75), and moderate driving fee ($0.50), benefiting both drivers and transit users while improving transit times. 2. Selected proposal 13 second as it maintains the current fare structure but improves service. 3. Chose proposal 4 third for its lower tax impact while maintaining service improvements. 4. Ranked proposal 19 fourth as it provides good transit times but higher tax impact. 5. Selected proposal 1 fifth for its minimal tax impact while still improving transit service."
