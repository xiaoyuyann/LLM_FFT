    "disposable_income": "Median income is $69,810, with about 37.7% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests moderate disposable income but significant population segment is budget-sensitive",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and household sizes, many families need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses. Higher sales taxes would impact discretionary spending for lower-income households",
    "accessibility": "Mixed transportation profile with 43.8% driving alone, 24.5% using transit, and 23.8% no vehicle households. Good balance of transit and driving needs must be considered. Location provides decent access to downtown and other employment centers",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals that balance moderate transit fares with minimal sales tax burden given income distribution. 2. Consider significant transit-dependent population (23.8% no vehicle). 3. Need reasonable driving costs as 43.8% drive alone to work. 4. Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times without excessive cost burden. 6. Ranked based on combined impact on both transit and driving accessibility while maintaining affordability"
