    "disposable_income": "West Englewood has a very low median income of $29,234, with 69.5% of households earning less than $50,000. This indicates extremely limited disposable income for transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 42.1% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is severely constrained. Higher sales taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact basic needs spending",
    "accessibility": "32.7% of households have no vehicle, and 25.9% rely on transit. The community needs affordable transit options while maintaining reasonable service levels. Current transit travel times are more than double driving times",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given very low incomes, prioritized lowest fare ($0.75) and tax (0.5%) options first\n2. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs low\n3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) help fund transit improvements without excessive burden\n4. Avoided highest tax/fare combinations due to poverty levels\n5. Balanced need for service improvements with community's limited ability to pay"
