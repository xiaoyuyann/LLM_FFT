    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale is a low-income community with 63% of households making less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $33,334. This suggests residents are particularly sensitive to cost increases from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, as would increased transit fares or driving fees given the community's reliance on both modes.",
    "accessibility": "36.5% of households have no vehicle, while 40.7% have one vehicle. 23.7% use transit and 57.3% drive alone for commuting. This split suggests policies need to balance both transit and driving accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest tax rate (0.5%) to minimize impact on purchasing power. 2. Balance low transit fares for the significant transit-dependent population. 3. Moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Focus on options that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility. 5. Consider that many households rely on both transit and driving, so avoid extreme penalties on either mode."
