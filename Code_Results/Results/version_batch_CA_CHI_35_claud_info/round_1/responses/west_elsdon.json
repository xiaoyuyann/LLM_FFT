    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon has a median household income of $64,441, with 40.5% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. The per capita income of $27,703 suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents sensitive to cost increases",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 3.3, many families likely have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets, especially for the 40.5% lower-income households",
    "accessibility": "76.1% of residents drive (59.6% alone, 16.5% carpool), while 12.9% use transit. 86.5% of households own at least one vehicle, indicating high car dependency. The mean commute time of 36.3 minutes suggests significant transportation needs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given moderate incomes and high car dependency, prioritize proposals with lower taxes and driving fees. 2. Consider moderate transit fares to maintain service quality while keeping costs accessible for transit users. 3. Balance between driving costs and transit improvements since most residents drive but significant minority uses transit. 4. Avoid highest tax rates (1.5%) due to impact on discretionary spending. 5. Select proposals that reduce commute times without excessive cost burden"
