    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn has relatively low income levels with median income of $43,293 and 55.3% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With low per capita income ($20,907) and large household sizes (avg 3.0), discretionary spending is limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets given the high proportion of low-income residents.",
    "accessibility": "24.3% have no vehicle access, while 39.8% have one vehicle. Transit usage (14.9%) is moderate while driving alone (57.8%) and carpooling (20.6%) are primary modes. This suggests need for both affordable transit and reasonable driving costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to preserve purchasing power. 2. With significant transit dependence, favor lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to maintain accessibility. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) can help improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance between transit time improvements and cost increases. 5. Selected proposals that reduce both transit and driving times while keeping costs manageable for mixed-mode community."
