    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has relatively low income levels with median income of $41,144 and 58.2% of households earning less than $50,000. About 33.8% earn less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes and transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets, especially for lower-income families who make up a large portion of the population",
    "accessibility": "19.4% of households have no vehicle, and 12.9% use transit for commuting. Mean commute time is 33.8 minutes. The community relies on both private vehicles (67.9% drive alone) and public transit, making both travel modes important",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on discretionary spending. 2. Lower transit fares ($0.75) are crucial for the significant transit-dependent population. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) can help improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden is essential given the mixed-mode usage. 5. Proposals that reduce transit travel time are valuable given the long average commute times"
