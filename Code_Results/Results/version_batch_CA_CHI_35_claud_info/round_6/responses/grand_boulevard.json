    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a relatively low median income of $43,048, with 53.6% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests limited disposable income for many residents, making them sensitive to transportation costs and tax increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With 35.5% of households earning less than $25,000, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, especially for essential purchases.",
    "accessibility": "30.3% of households have no vehicle, and 21.4% use transit for commuting. The community has a significant transit-dependent population, making transit affordability and service quality crucial. 49.3% drive alone, indicating a need to balance both transit and driving considerations.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize low transit fares due to high proportion of low-income and transit-dependent residents. 2. Moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Keep sales tax moderate to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Consider proposals that reduce transit travel time to support transit-dependent population."
