    "disposable_income": "Mixed-income community with 46.3% households earning under $50k, indicating significant budget constraints for many residents. About 29.5% earn over $100k, showing income diversity",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity for nearly half the population, making them sensitive to both fare increases and sales tax changes. Higher sales tax would particularly impact the 46.3% lower-income households",
    "accessibility": "76.3% of households have at least one vehicle, with high drive-alone (58.7%) and carpool (19.4%) rates. Transit usage is moderate at 13.1%, suggesting some transit dependency but primarily car-oriented community",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) due to large lower-income population. 2. Balance between transit improvement and driving costs given high car ownership but significant transit users. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) preferred over high fees ($1.00) to not overly burden the majority who drive. 4. Lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) favored to support transit-dependent population. 5. Focus on options that reduce transit travel time while maintaining reasonable driving conditions"
