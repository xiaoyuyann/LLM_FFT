    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a median income of $57,591, with 44.8% of households earning less than $50,000 annually. This suggests many residents have limited disposable income and would be sensitive to increased transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and cost of living in Chicago, many residents likely have modest discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would impact their ability to purchase non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The community has high transit usage (28.1%) and low car ownership (37.2% have no vehicle). The area is served by CTA Red Line and multiple bus routes, making transit accessibility crucial. Many residents rely on public transportation for daily commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies that keep transit fares low ($0.75) given high transit dependency and lower incomes. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without excessive burden. 3. Selected lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Considered high proportion of car-free households and transit commuters."
