    "disposable_income": "West Pullman has relatively low income levels with median income of $46,861 and 52.3% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests limited disposable income and high sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households and per capita income of $24,916, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact their ability to spend on other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "23.4% households have no vehicle, making them transit-dependent. However, only 12% use transit while 75.8% drive/carpool, suggesting limited transit accessibility. Current transit travel times are significantly higher than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent population. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening majority who drive. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel time from current 58.8 minutes while keeping costs manageable."
