    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $61,898, with 41.8% earning less than $50,000. This suggests moderate disposable income levels, making residents sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 3.2, discretionary spending is likely constrained. Higher taxes or fees would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "High car dependency with 90.5% of households having at least one vehicle, 68.4% drive alone to work, only 7.7% use transit. Mean commute time is 36.4 minutes, suggesting significant travel needs",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5%) due to moderate income levels. 2) Favored policies with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 3) Selected moderate transit fares ($1.25) to balance service quality and affordability. 4) Considered high car ownership rates and current travel patterns. 5) Focused on options that reduce overall travel times while keeping costs manageable for working families"
