    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a relatively wealthy area with 61.3% of households earning over $100,000 annually. However, there's income diversity with about 20% earning under $50,000. This suggests most residents can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the high income levels, residents likely have significant discretionary spending. The 1-1.5% sales tax impact would be notable given higher consumption levels, but manageable for most residents.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit access and walkability, with only 22.7% driving. 50.5% of households don't own cars, and 47.9% use transit or walk/bike. The Loop is a transit-rich environment where improving transit service could benefit the majority.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high transit usage and low car ownership, prioritize policies that improve transit times while keeping fares moderate. 2. Higher driving fees are acceptable since most residents don't drive and it will reduce congestion. 3. Moderate sales tax increase is acceptable given income levels. 4. Selected policies that balance transit improvement with reasonable costs. 5. Focused on options that significantly reduce transit travel times while maintaining affordability for lower-income residents."
