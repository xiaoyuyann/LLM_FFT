    "disposable_income": "Ashburn has a median household income of $78,060 and per capita income of $28,910. About 30.6% of households earn less than $50,000, while 35.6% earn over $100,000, indicating a mixed-income community with significant middle and upper-middle class presence",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With moderate to high car ownership (92.3% households have at least one vehicle) and median income levels, residents have some discretionary spending capacity but are likely sensitive to additional taxes and fees that could impact their consumption",
    "accessibility": "The community heavily relies on cars (67.6% drive alone, 11.1% carpool) with only 11.4% using transit. The high vehicle ownership suggests good road access but potentially limited transit options",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, prefer policies with lower driving fees to avoid burdening majority of residents. 2. Moderate tax rates preferred to balance transit improvement with household budgets. 3. Lower transit fares could encourage more transit use without severely impacting service quality. 4. Consider policies that reduce travel times for both modes to benefit all residents. 5. Balance between maintaining affordable transit access while not overly penalizing necessary car use"
