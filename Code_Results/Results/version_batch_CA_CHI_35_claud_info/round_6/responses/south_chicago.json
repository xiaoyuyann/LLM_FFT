    "disposable_income": "South Chicago is a lower-income community with median income of $43,936, significantly below Chicago's average. About 55.6% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, indicating limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of low-income households, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes and transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets and consumption patterns",
    "accessibility": "31.6% of households have no vehicle, and 23.7% rely on transit for commuting. While 58.2% drive alone, the high proportion of transit-dependent residents suggests need for affordable and efficient public transit",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) given large transit-dependent population and low incomes. 2. Favored lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending power. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 55 minutes while keeping fares affordable"
