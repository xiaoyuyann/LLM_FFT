    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge has a relatively high median income of $90,374, with 46% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have moderate to high disposable income and can absorb some transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With higher income levels, residents have significant discretionary spending power. However, the community has large household sizes (2.8 average), which means household expenses need to be managed carefully.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with 92.2% of households owning at least one vehicle and 71.2% driving alone to work. Only 7.6% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility or preference for driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and driving rates, policies that minimize driving costs while maintaining good car travel times are preferred. 2. With higher incomes, moderate tax increases are acceptable if they improve overall service. 3. Since transit usage is low, very high transit fares are less concerning. 4. Proposals balancing moderate driving fees with service improvements are favorable. 5. Lower sales tax options are preferred to preserve discretionary spending power."
