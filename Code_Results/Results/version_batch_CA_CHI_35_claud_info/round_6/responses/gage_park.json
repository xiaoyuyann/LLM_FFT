    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class community with median income of $50,112 and per capita income of $19,524. About 50% of households earn less than $50,000 annually, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high percentage of lower-income households and large average household size (3.4), discretionary spending is likely constrained. Higher sales taxes or transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "20.5% of households have no vehicle, and 17.9% use transit for commuting. While 59.6% drive alone, the high proportion of transit-dependent residents suggests need for affordable, efficient transit service",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents\n2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income\n3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers\n4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost considerations\n5. Considered high proportion of both transit users and drivers in community"
