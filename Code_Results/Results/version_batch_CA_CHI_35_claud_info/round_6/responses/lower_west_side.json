    "disposable_income": "Median household income is $69,810, with about 37.7% households earning less than $50,000. This suggests many residents have limited disposable income and would be sensitive to increased transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and average household size of 2.4, many families have modest discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes would impact their purchasing power significantly.",
    "accessibility": "The area has mixed transportation usage with 43.8% driving alone, 24.5% using transit, and 23.8% households without vehicles. Good transit access is crucial for many residents, while drivers also need consideration.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending power. 2. Balanced transit fares around $1.25 to maintain service quality while keeping transit affordable. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit the significant transit-dependent population. 5. Considered the large proportion of lower-income households who would be sensitive to cost increases."
