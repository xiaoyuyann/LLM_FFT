    "disposable_income": "Englewood has very limited disposable income with 46.5% households earning less than $25,000 and median income of $27,792, which is significantly below Chicago's average. Any additional transportation costs would have a major impact on household budgets.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, discretionary spending is minimal. Most income likely goes to essential needs. Higher sales taxes would disproportionately burden residents, reducing already limited purchasing power for basic necessities.",
    "accessibility": "44.6% of households have no vehicle, making transit accessibility crucial. 25.2% rely on transit for commuting while 51% drive alone. The community needs affordable transit options while maintaining reasonable driving costs for car-dependent households.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lowest tax rate (0.5%) due to low income levels. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help transit-dependent residents. 3. Moderate driving fees ($0.50) acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times from current 58.8 minutes while keeping fares affordable."
