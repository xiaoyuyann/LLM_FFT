    "disposable_income": "Riverdale has relatively low income levels with median income of $41,144 and 58.2% of households making less than $50,000. About 33.8% make less than $25,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity. Higher sales taxes and transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets, especially for lower-income families who make up a large portion of the population",
    "accessibility": "67.9% drive alone and 12.9% use transit for commuting. 19.4% have no vehicle access. Mean commute time is 33.8 minutes. The community needs both affordable transit options and reasonable driving costs given the mixed transportation needs",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) and lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to maintain affordability. 2. Consider moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden given significant transit-dependent population. 4. Avoid highest tax rate (1.5%) due to impact on limited discretionary income. 5. Prioritize proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping costs manageable"
