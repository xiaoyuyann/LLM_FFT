    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale is a low-income community with 63% of households making less than $50,000 annually and a median income of $33,334. This suggests residents are particularly sensitive to cost increases from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of low-income households, discretionary spending is likely very limited. Higher sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets, as would increased transit fares or driving fees given the community's reliance on both modes.",
    "accessibility": "36.5% of households have no vehicle, while 40.7% have one vehicle. 23.7% use transit and 57.3% drive alone for commuting. This split suggests policies need to balance both transit and driving accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritized lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on purchasing power. 2. Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable for the large car-less population. 3. Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Sought balance between transit and driving times given mixed mode usage. 5. Prioritized proposals that reduce total travel times while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents."
