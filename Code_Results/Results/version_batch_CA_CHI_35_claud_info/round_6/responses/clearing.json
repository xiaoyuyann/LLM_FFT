    "disposable_income": "Clearing has a median household income of $73,778, with 49.2% of households earning over $75,000. However, 32.8% earn less than $50,000, indicating a mixed income distribution that needs consideration for transportation costs",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a moderate per capita income of $33,089, residents have some discretionary spending power but would be sensitive to increased transportation costs and sales taxes that could affect their consumption patterns",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars with 92% of households having at least one vehicle and 74.1% driving alone to work. Only 6.9% use transit, suggesting limited transit accessibility or preference for driving. Mean commute time is 31.9 minutes",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency, prefer policies with lower driving fees but maintain decent transit service. 2. Consider moderate tax rates to balance service improvements with household budgets. 3. Prefer policies that reduce commute times for drivers while keeping transit affordable. 4. Balance between maintaining car accessibility and improving transit for the 8% no-vehicle households. 5. Select policies that minimize impact on discretionary spending while improving transportation efficiency"
