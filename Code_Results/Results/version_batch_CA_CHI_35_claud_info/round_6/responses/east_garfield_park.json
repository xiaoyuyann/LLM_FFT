    "disposable_income": "Very limited disposable income with median household income of $31,762, and 43.7% of households earning less than $25,000. This suggests high sensitivity to any cost increases from taxes, fares, or fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, discretionary consumption is likely minimal. Any additional transportation costs would significantly impact household budgets and reduce already limited discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "40% of households have no vehicle, and 25% use transit for commuting. Mean commute time is 35.1 minutes. High dependence on both public transit and driving (51% drive alone), suggesting need for balanced but affordable transportation options.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lowest combined cost burden (low tax, fare, and fees). 2. High transit usage requires maintaining service quality while keeping fares affordable. 3. Consider significant car-dependent population but avoid high driving fees due to income constraints. 4. Selected proposals balance reduced transit fares with moderate improvements in transit times. 5. Avoided highest tax rates (1.5%) due to impact on limited discretionary income. Selected proposals 0, 9, 3, 1, and 10 in decreasing order of preference to minimize cost burden while maintaining reasonable service levels."
