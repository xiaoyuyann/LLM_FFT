    "disposable_income": "South Shore has relatively low income levels with median income of $39,649 and 56.5% of households making less than $50,000. This suggests high sensitivity to costs from fares, fees, and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower income levels and high percentage of households below $50,000, discretionary spending is likely limited. Additional transportation costs and sales taxes would significantly impact household budgets",
    "accessibility": "High transit dependency with 37.8% having no vehicle and 32.8% using transit for commuting. 49.8% drive alone, suggesting a mixed-mode community needing balance between transit and driving options",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) given high transit usage and low incomes. 2. Moderate sales tax (1%) to maintain service quality without excessive burden. 3. Consider modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times while keeping costs manageable for both transit users and drivers"
