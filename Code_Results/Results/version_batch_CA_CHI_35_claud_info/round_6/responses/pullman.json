    "accessibility": "64% drive alone and 17.6% use transit for commuting. 16.1% have no vehicle, while 49.8% have one vehicle. Good transit access is important for both car-free households and single-car families",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Balance moderate transit fares ($1.25) with service quality. 3. Support driving fee of $0.50 to improve transit without excessive burden on drivers. 4. Consider high transit usage among no-vehicle households. 5. Factor in majority of single-vehicle households who need both driving and transit options. Selected policies optimize travel times while maintaining affordability"
