    "disposable_income": "Edison Park is a relatively affluent community with median income of $120,024 and 59.4% of households earning over $100,000. This suggests residents have significant disposable income and can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high per capita income ($57,872), residents likely have substantial discretionary spending. A sales tax increase would affect this spending, but impact would be manageable given income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Car-centric community with 93.5% of households owning at least one vehicle and 69.1% driving alone to work. Only 8.4% use transit, suggesting car-dependency but potential for transit growth with improved service.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car ownership and usage, prioritize proposals with moderate driving fees to reduce congestion while maintaining reasonable car costs. 2. Higher sales tax is acceptable given income levels if it improves transit service. 3. Moderate transit fares preferred to balance service quality with accessibility. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce both car and transit travel times. 5. Consider proposals that could encourage more transit use while not overly burdening drivers."
