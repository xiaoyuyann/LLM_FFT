    "disposable_income": "Hegewisch has a median income of $58,647, with 45.6% households earning less than $50,000. The community has moderate disposable income, making residents sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income distribution and cost of living in Chicago, many households have limited discretionary spending capacity. 27.6% earn less than $25,000, suggesting many residents would be significantly impacted by increased transportation costs",
    "accessibility": "The area heavily relies on cars (65.2% drive alone) with limited transit usage (10.8%). 87.4% of households have at least one vehicle, indicating car-dependent mobility patterns. The community needs balanced policies that don't overly burden drivers while improving transit service",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending. 2. Moderate driving fees ($0.5) to improve transit without excessive burden on majority car-dependent population. 3. Lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to help lower-income residents and encourage transit use. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost increases. 5. Consider proposals that reduce both transit and driving times without extreme cost increases"
