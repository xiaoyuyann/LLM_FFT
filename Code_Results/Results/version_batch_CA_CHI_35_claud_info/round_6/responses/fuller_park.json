    "disposable_income": "Fuller Park is a low-income community with 70% of households earning less than $25,000 annually, and 85.8% earning less than $50,000. This indicates very limited disposable income for most residents",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With such low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity. Any increase in transportation costs or sales tax would significantly impact their ability to afford basic necessities",
    "accessibility": "58% of households have no vehicle, making them heavily dependent on public transit. While 49.3% drive alone and 22.6% carpool, 18.7% rely on transit. The community needs affordable and efficient transit options",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) due to high poverty rates and transit dependency. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to preserve purchasing power. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening carpoolers. 4. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on low-income residents. 5. Consider high proportion of both transit users and carpoolers in the community"
