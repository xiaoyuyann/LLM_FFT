    "disposable_income": "The disposable income in Gulfgate Riverview / Pine Valley is relatively moderate, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is limited, with residents prioritizing essential expenses such as housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, reducing travel times and enhancing accessibility. The focus is on balancing cost with improved transit efficiency to benefit both transit users and drivers. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, coupled with moderate sales tax rates, are prioritized to ensure affordability and improved service."
