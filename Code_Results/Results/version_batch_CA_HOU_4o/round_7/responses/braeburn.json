    "disposable_income": "Braeburn has a moderate to low disposable income level, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Braeburn have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Braeburn has moderate accessibility to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the area and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit can reduce reliance on personal vehicles and lower overall transportation costs. The top-ranked proposals balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both driving and public transit."
