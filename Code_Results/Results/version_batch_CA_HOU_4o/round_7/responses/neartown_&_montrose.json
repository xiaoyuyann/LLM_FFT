    "disposable_income": "Neartown / Montrose is a relatively affluent area with a higher-than-average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Neartown / Montrose tend to have higher discretionary spending on dining, entertainment, and cultural activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good access to public transit and is walkable, with many amenities and services within a short distance.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood's good access to public transit means that policies that enhance transit efficiency and reduce congestion are beneficial. A balance between tax rates and fare/fee levels is crucial to ensure that the community's discretionary consumption is not overly impacted. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax and driver fees, combined with reduced travel times, are prioritized."
