    "disposable_income": "Fort Bend / Houston has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents having stable employment and a reasonable amount of income left after essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to spend on a variety of goods and services, including dining, entertainment, and education, indicating a balanced discretionary consumption pattern.",
    "accessibility": "The area has decent accessibility to resources and services, but improvements in transit could enhance connectivity and reduce reliance on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing transit fares and improving travel times are priorities to encourage public transit use, which can alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it leads to better transit options. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales tax rates are preferred to balance cost and service improvements."
