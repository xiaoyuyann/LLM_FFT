    "disposable_income": "Westbury has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbury have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Westbury has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Westbury's moderate disposable income, it is important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening residents financially. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times and accessibility. The selected policies prioritize reducing travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while ensuring that the financial impact on residents remains manageable."
