    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The community values efficient transportation options that reduce congestion and travel time. Therefore, proposals with moderate to high driver fees and transit fares, which lead to reduced travel times, are prioritized. A balance is sought between maintaining reasonable costs and achieving better service and reduced congestion."
