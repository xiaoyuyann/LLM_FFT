    "disposable_income": "Alief is a diverse community with a moderate to low average disposable income, where many residents are budget-conscious.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Alief prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Alief has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the area and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income in Alief, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve disposable income for essential goods. However, improving transit times is important to enhance accessibility and reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Therefore, proposals that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. Proposal 1 offers the lowest fare and driving fee with improved transit times, making it the top choice. Proposal 7 and 10 offer a reasonable balance of cost and transit time improvements. Proposal 16 and 19, while having a higher sales tax, offer significant improvements in transit times, which could benefit residents who rely on public transportation."
