    "disposable_income": "Central Southwest has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for many residents, but current services are limited, making accessibility to jobs and services challenging without a car.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels, affordability of transit fares and driving fees is crucial. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize financial strain. Improved transit times are also important to enhance accessibility. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is necessary, as higher taxes reduce disposable income. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate tax rates, and improved transit times are prioritized."
