    "disposable_income": "Willowbrook has a moderate disposable income level, with residents having some flexibility in their spending but still being sensitive to significant increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Willowbrook tend to have moderate discretionary consumption, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Willowbrook has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and public transit, though transit times are currently longer than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, it is important to balance cost increases with improvements in service. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening residents financially. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit service. Reducing travel times is a priority to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales taxes that result in reduced travel times are prioritized."
