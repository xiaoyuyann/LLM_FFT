    "disposable_income": "The Second Ward has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The Second Ward has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs for both transit and driving is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. Additionally, a moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected policies aim to balance cost savings with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both modes of transportation."
