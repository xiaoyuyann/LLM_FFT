    "disposable_income": "Magnolia Park is a working-class neighborhood with relatively low to moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Magnolia Park have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the need for efficient travel times to work and other services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times is also crucial to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit times and moderate tax rates are prioritized."
