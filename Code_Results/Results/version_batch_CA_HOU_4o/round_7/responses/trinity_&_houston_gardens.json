    "disposable_income": "The Trinity / Houston Gardens neighborhood generally has a lower disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this neighborhood have limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it is crucial to minimize costs for both transit and driving. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to ensure affordability. The sales tax is also considered, but a moderate rate is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel time is important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate tax rates that offer improved travel times, are prioritized."
