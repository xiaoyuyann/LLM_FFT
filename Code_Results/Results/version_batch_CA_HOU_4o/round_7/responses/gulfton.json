    "disposable_income": "Gulfton is a lower-income neighborhood with many residents working in low-wage jobs, meaning disposable income is limited.",

    "accessibility": "Gulfton has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on it due to lower car ownership rates compared to other neighborhoods.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, it is crucial to minimize costs for residents while improving transit accessibility. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting residents' budgets. A lower sales tax is also favored to avoid reducing disposable income further. The selected policies aim to balance cost savings with improved transit times, which can enhance accessibility and reduce reliance on personal vehicles."
