    "disposable_income": "South Acres / Crestmont Park has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",

    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep transportation costs affordable while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting residents' budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden the community. The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and service improvement, prioritizing options that reduce travel time and cost for both transit users and drivers."
