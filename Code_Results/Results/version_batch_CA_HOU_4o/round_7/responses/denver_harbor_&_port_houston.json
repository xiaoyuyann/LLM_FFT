    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor / Port Houston has a relatively low disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the limited reach and frequency of transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with a moderate sales tax and lower fares and fees that also offer reduced travel times are prioritized. This approach aims to improve transit services without significantly increasing costs for residents."
