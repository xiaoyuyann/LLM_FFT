    "disposable_income": "The Washington Avenue Coalition / Memorial Park area generally has a higher disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have higher discretionary spending, often on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, the community can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on balancing cost with improved accessibility and reduced congestion. Proposals with a moderate sales tax and driver fee, combined with lower transit fares, are prioritized to encourage transit use while maintaining affordability. The top-ranked proposals offer a good balance of reduced travel times and costs, supporting both drivers and transit users."
