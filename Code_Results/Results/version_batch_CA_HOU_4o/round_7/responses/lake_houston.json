    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake Houston have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. However, a balance must be struck to ensure that the cost of living does not increase excessively due to higher sales taxes. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to public transit, which could alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax, lower transit fares, and reasonable driving fees that offer significant reductions in travel times are prioritized."
