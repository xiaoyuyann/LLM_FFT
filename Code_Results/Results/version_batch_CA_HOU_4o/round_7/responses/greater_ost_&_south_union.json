    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a significant portion of the population relying on public transit due to limited car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low to moderate disposable income, it is important to prioritize policies that minimize costs for residents while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid burdening residents with additional costs. Therefore, policies with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also improve transit times, are prioritized."
