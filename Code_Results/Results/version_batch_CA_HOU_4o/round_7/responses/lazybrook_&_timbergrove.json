    "disposable_income": "Lazybrook / Timbergrove is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood with relatively high disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lazybrook / Timbergrove have moderate to high discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, leisure, and home improvements.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and car ownership being common among residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the relatively high disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significant improvements in transit times. The neighborhood values efficient transportation, so proposals that reduce travel time are prioritized. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial, as residents are willing to pay slightly higher taxes for better services but prefer to keep them moderate to maintain discretionary spending. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driving fees are favored to encourage transit use while maintaining car convenience."
