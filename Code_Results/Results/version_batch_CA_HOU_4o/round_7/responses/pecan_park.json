    "disposable_income": "Pecan Park has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs and relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community prioritizes essential spending, with limited discretionary income available for non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Pecan Park has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the need for efficient travel to work and other essential services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep both transit fares and driving fees affordable to avoid burdening residents financially. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending power. The community would benefit from improved transit times to encourage public transportation use, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate tax rates, and improved travel times are prioritized."
