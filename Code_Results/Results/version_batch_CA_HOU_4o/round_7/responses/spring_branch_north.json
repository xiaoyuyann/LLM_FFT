    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected policies prioritize reducing travel times and costs while maintaining a reasonable tax rate to support transit improvements."
