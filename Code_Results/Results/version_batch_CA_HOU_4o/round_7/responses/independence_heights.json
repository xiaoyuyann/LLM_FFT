    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for Independence Heights, as many residents depend on it for access to jobs, education, and healthcare, though current transit times are lengthy.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's reliance on affordable transit and limited disposable income, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals that balance lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit services and reduce congestion, are favored. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit efficiency, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' consumption of essential goods."
