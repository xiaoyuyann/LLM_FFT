    "disposable_income": "Brays Oaks has a moderate to low disposable income level, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Brays Oaks have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of services and employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and lower overall transportation costs. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both transit and personal vehicles."
