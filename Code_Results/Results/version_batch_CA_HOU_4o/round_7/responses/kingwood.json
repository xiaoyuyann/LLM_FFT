    "disposable_income": "Kingwood is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kingwood have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and other non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Kingwood has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Kingwood's higher disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees could encourage some residents to switch to transit, reducing congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable given the community's income levels, as it would enhance transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and moderate sales taxes are prioritized to balance improved transit services with cost considerations."
