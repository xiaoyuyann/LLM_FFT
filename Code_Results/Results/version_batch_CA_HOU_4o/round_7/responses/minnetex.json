    "accessibility": "Public transit options are limited, making car travel a necessity for many residents to access jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on cars. The focus is on balancing cost savings with improved transit efficiency to enhance accessibility without imposing high costs on residents."
