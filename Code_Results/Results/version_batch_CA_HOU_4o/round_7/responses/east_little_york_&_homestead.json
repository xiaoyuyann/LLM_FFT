    "disposable_income": "East Little York / Homestead has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current services are limited, leading to longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. Therefore, lower transit fares and driver fees are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. Improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility and reduce travel time. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The selected policies balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while considering the community's financial constraints."
