    "disposable_income": "Pleasantville Area has a relatively low disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Pleasantville Area have limited discretionary consumption, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are prioritized to ensure affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. The selected proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while maintaining a manageable tax rate."
