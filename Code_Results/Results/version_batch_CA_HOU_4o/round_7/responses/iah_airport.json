    "disposable_income": "The IAH Airport area has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in airport-related jobs and service industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is moderate, with spending focused on essential services and some leisure activities, influenced by the proximity to the airport.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and transit due to the airport's location and the need for efficient transportation options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while ensuring that the community can afford the changes without sacrificing other essential expenditures."
