    "disposable_income": "Westbranch has a moderate disposable income level, with residents having some flexibility in their spending but still being sensitive to significant increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to spend on essential goods and services, with limited room for luxury spending, making cost increases in transportation a concern.",
    "accessibility": "Westbranch has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and public transit, making improvements in transit times and costs beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, Westbranch residents would benefit from policies that balance cost with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on overall consumption. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also improve transit times, are prioritized. The selected proposals aim to enhance transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for residents."
