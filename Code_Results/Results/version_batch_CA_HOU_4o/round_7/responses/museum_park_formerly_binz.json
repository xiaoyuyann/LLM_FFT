    "disposable_income": "Museum Park is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Museum Park have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on cultural, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Museum Park has good accessibility to resources and services, with multiple transit options and proximity to major city attractions.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency, as many residents value time savings and environmental benefits. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, but the community prefers to avoid the highest tax rate to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate taxes, reasonable fares, and driver fees that lead to reduced travel times are prioritized."
