    "disposable_income": "Kashmere Gardens has a relatively low disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kashmere Gardens have limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited accessibility to resources and services, with a significant reliance on public transit due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and reliance on public transit, it is crucial to prioritize policies that minimize costs for residents while improving transit services. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fees can encourage more people to use public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this will benefit the majority of residents who rely on public transportation. Therefore, the focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit efficiency and accessibility."
