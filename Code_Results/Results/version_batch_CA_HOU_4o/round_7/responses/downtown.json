    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a high level of discretionary consumption with numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options available.",
    "accessibility": "Downtown has excellent accessibility to resources and services, with robust public transit options and walkability, but also experiences significant traffic congestion.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Downtown residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced congestion. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency, as many residents rely on public transportation. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower transit fares, moderate sales tax, and higher driver fees are prioritized to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion."
