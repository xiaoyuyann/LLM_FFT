    "disposable_income": "Greenway / Upper Kirby is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greenway / Upper Kirby tend to have higher discretionary spending on luxury goods, dining, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better service and reduced travel times. The focus is on balancing improved transit times with reasonable costs, while also considering the impact of sales tax on discretionary spending. Proposals with moderate sales tax and driver fees, but lower transit fares, are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, aligning with the community's ability to absorb these costs without significantly impacting their lifestyle."
