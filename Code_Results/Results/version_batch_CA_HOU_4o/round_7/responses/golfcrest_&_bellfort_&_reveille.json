    "disposable_income": "The Golfcrest / Bellfort / Reveille neighborhood has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a significant portion of the population relying on public transit due to limited car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep transit fares affordable while improving service efficiency. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The neighborhood would benefit from reduced travel times, especially for transit, to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which encourage a shift from driving to transit, are prioritized. The balance between tax, fare, and driver fees is considered to ensure affordability and improved transit services."
