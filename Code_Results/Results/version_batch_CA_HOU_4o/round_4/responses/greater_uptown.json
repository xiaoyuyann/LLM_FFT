    "disposable_income": "Greater Uptown is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Uptown have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, dining, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, but traffic congestion can be an issue.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better service and reduced congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable to support transit improvements. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency, as many residents rely on both driving and public transit. Therefore, proposals that balance moderate costs with significant improvements in travel time and service quality are prioritized."
