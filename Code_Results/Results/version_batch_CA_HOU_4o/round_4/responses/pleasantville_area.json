    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are prioritized to ensure affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. The selected policies balance these factors by offering lower fares and fees while slightly increasing the sales tax to enhance transit services."
