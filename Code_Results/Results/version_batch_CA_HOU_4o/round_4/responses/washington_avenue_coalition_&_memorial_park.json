    "disposable_income": "The Washington Avenue Coalition / Memorial Park area generally has a higher disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have higher discretionary spending, often on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood's good accessibility means that improvements in transit times could encourage more residents to use public transportation, reducing congestion. Therefore, proposals with moderate to high driver fees and transit fares, which significantly reduce travel times, are prioritized. A balance is sought between maintaining reasonable costs and achieving substantial improvements in transit efficiency."
