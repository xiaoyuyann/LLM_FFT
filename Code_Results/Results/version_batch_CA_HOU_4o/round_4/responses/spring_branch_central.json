    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch Central has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch Central have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents, while moderate sales tax rates are acceptable to support transit improvements. The focus is on proposals that offer significant reductions in travel time, especially for transit, without imposing high costs on residents. Proposals with a $0.75 transit fare and moderate driving fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while maintaining affordability."
