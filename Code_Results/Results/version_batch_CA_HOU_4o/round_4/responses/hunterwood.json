    "disposable_income": "Hunterwood has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Hunterwood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. Additionally, reducing travel times is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, the selected policies aim to provide better transit services while keeping costs manageable for residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit efficiency and reduces travel times."
