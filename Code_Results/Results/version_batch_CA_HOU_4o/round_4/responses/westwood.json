    "disposable_income": "Westwood has a moderate to low disposable income level, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Westwood has moderate accessibility to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, reducing travel times and encouraging public transit use. The top-ranked proposals balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, aiming to reduce travel times and costs for both drivers and transit users."
