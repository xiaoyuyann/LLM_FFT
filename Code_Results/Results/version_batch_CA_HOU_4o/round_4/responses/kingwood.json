    "disposable_income": "Kingwood is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kingwood have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and other non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Kingwood has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Kingwood's higher disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, the community can absorb moderate increases in driving fees and sales taxes if it results in significant improvements in transit times and reduced congestion. The focus is on balancing cost with improved transit efficiency to potentially encourage some shift from driving to transit, thereby reducing congestion. Lower transit fares are less critical due to the higher income levels, but reduced travel times are highly valued. Therefore, proposals with moderate taxes and fees that significantly improve transit times and slightly reduce driving times are prioritized."
