    "disposable_income": "The IAH Airport super neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in airport-related industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending focused on essential goods and services due to the nature of employment in the area.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services by car, but transit options are less efficient, leading to longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. Reducing travel time is also a priority to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax, which improve transit times without significantly increasing costs, are preferred. Proposals that balance these factors while reducing travel times for both transit and driving are ranked higher."
