    "disposable_income": "Afton Oaks / River Oaks is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this neighborhood have significant discretionary spending, often on luxury goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a high rate of car ownership and less reliance on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary spending, the community can absorb higher costs if it results in better services. However, the preference is to maintain or improve transit times and reduce congestion. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without significantly impacting discretionary spending. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to improved transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized, balancing cost and service improvement."
