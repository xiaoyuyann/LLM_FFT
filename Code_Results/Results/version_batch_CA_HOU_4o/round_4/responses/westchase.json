    "disposable_income": "Westchase has a moderate to high disposable income level, with many residents employed in professional and managerial positions.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westchase have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "Westchase has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making driving a common choice.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Westchase residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The community values efficient transportation options, so proposals that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are prioritized. A balance between tax rates and user fees is important to ensure that the cost burden is not too high, while still improving transit services. Proposals with a moderate sales tax and reasonable fare and fee structures that lead to reduced travel times are preferred."
