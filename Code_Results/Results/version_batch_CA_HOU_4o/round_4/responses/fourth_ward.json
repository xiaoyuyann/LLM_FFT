    "disposable_income": "The Fourth Ward has a mixed-income population with a significant portion of residents having moderate to low disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Fourth Ward tend to have limited discretionary spending due to the cost of living and income levels.",
    "accessibility": "The Fourth Ward has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax rates that offer reduced travel times, are prioritized."
