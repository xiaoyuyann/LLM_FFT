    "disposable_income": "East Little York / Homestead has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, prioritizing essential goods and services due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current services are limited, leading to longer travel times and reduced accessibility to resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, affordability of transit fares and driver fees is crucial. A lower fare and moderate driver fee can improve transit services without significantly impacting residents' budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times is also important to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales taxes that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
