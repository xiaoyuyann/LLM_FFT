    "disposable_income": "Lazybrook / Timbergrove is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood with relatively high disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lazybrook / Timbergrove have moderate to high discretionary spending, often prioritizing quality of life and convenience.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent access to resources and services, with a mix of car and transit usage, though car travel is more prevalent due to convenience.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can alleviate congestion and improve environmental outcomes. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales taxes, that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
