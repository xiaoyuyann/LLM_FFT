    "disposable_income": "The Jensen super neighborhood has a relatively low disposable income, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs such as transit fares and driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Due to limited disposable income, discretionary consumption is low, and any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact residents' ability to spend on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income and the need to maintain affordability, proposals with lower transit fares and driver fees are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could enhance accessibility and reduce travel times. The focus is on balancing cost with improved transit efficiency to benefit the community without imposing excessive financial burdens."
