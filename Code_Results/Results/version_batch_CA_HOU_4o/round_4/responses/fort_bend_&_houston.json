    "disposable_income": "Fort Bend / Houston has a moderate to high disposable income level, with many residents having the financial flexibility to absorb slight increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a diverse range of discretionary spending habits, with a focus on family-oriented activities and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has decent accessibility to resources and services, but improvements in transit could significantly enhance connectivity and reduce reliance on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it results in better transit services. Reducing travel time is a priority, as it enhances quality of life and access to opportunities. Therefore, proposals that offer significant reductions in transit time and moderate driving fees are preferred. A balance between fare, tax, and driving fees is crucial to ensure that both drivers and transit users benefit. Proposals with a 1% sales tax are favored as they provide a good balance between cost and service improvement, while keeping fares and driving fees reasonable."
