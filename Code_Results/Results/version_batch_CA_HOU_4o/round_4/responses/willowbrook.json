    "disposable_income": "Willowbrook has a moderate disposable income level, with residents having some flexibility in their spending but still sensitive to significant increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Willowbrook tend to have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and are cautious about additional expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Willowbrook has decent accessibility to resources and services, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit the community, especially for those who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to noticeable improvements in transit times. The top-ranked policies prioritize reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while considering the impact of sales tax on overall consumption."
