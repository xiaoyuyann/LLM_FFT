    "disposable_income": "The Addicks / Park Ten neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in the energy sector and related industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and travel.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility by car due to proximity to major highways, but public transit options are less developed, leading to longer travel times by transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in taxes and fees if it results in significantly improved transit services. The neighborhood's reliance on cars suggests that reducing driving time and costs is important, but there is also a need to improve transit to offer viable alternatives. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A balanced approach with moderate sales tax is chosen to ensure sufficient funding for transit improvements without overly burdening residents' discretionary spending."
