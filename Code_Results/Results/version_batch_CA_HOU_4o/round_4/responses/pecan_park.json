    "disposable_income": "Pecan Park has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Pecan Park have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Pecan Park has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the need for efficient travel to work and other services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and lower overall transportation costs. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both transit and personal vehicles."
