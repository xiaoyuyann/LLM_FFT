    "disposable_income": "Eldridge / West Oaks is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Eldridge / West Oaks have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, dining, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on personal vehicles due to limited public transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to public transit, which can alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate taxes, reasonable fares, and driver fees that lead to reduced travel times are prioritized."
