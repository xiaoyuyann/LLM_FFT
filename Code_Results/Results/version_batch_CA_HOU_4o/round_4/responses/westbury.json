    "disposable_income": "Westbury has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbury have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Westbury has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban layout and the need to commute to other parts of Houston for work and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel time and improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can benefit those who rely on public transportation. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and fees while considering the potential for reduced travel times and improved transit services."
