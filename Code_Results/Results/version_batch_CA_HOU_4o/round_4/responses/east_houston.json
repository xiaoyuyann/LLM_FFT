    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for East Houston, as many residents rely on it for commuting to work and accessing essential services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. However, improving transit times is also crucial due to the reliance on public transportation. A balance between affordable fares and reasonable travel times is necessary. Lower sales tax rates are preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which improve transit times without significantly increasing costs, are prioritized."
