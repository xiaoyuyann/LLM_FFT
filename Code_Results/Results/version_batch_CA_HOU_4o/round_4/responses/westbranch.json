    "disposable_income": "Westbranch has a moderate disposable income level, with residents having some flexibility in their spending but still sensitive to significant increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbranch allocate a fair portion of their income to discretionary spending, including dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Westbranch has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel time and improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening residents financially. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can enhance accessibility and reduce congestion. The selected policies aim to optimize travel time reductions and cost-effectiveness for both transit users and drivers."
