    "disposable_income": "Carverdale has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Carverdale has limited public transit options, making car travel a necessity for many residents, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Carverdale's moderate income levels, policies with lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize financial strain. However, improving transit times is also crucial to enhance accessibility for non-drivers. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate sales tax and lower fares and fees are prioritized to ensure affordability while supporting transit improvements. The top choices reflect a balance between cost savings and improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both cars and public transit."
