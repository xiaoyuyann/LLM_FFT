    "disposable_income": "Acres Home has a relatively low median household income compared to other Houston neighborhoods, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Acres Home have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Acres Home has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the neighborhood and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and discretionary spending in Acres Home, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. Additionally, improving transit times is crucial to enhance accessibility for residents who rely on public transportation. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, coupled with reduced travel times, are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents' consumption of essential goods."
