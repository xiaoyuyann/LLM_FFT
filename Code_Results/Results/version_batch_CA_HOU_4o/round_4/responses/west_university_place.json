    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford higher fares and fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times.

Therefore, proposals that offer the shortest travel times and improved transit services, even at a higher cost, are prioritized. The decision also considers the potential for reduced congestion and emissions, aligning with the community's preference for sustainable and efficient transportation solutions."
