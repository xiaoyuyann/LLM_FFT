    "accessibility": "Midtown has good accessibility to resources and services, with a well-connected transit system and walkable areas, but traffic congestion can be an issue.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency, as many residents rely on public transportation. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and driver fees, combined with lower sales taxes, are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements."
