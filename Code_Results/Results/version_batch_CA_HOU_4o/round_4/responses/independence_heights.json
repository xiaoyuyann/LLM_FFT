    "disposable_income": "Independence Heights has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for many residents, but current transit times are long, and accessibility to resources and services is limited without a car.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve discretionary spending. Improved transit times are crucial to enhance accessibility, so policies that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. Balancing these factors, the top choices aim to improve transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for residents."
