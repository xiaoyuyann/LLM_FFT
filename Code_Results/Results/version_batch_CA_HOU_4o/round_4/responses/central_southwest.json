    "disposable_income": "Central Southwest has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for many residents, but current transit times are long, and car ownership is moderate, making efficient transit options important.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. Reducing transit times is crucial to improve accessibility and encourage transit use. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on essential spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. The top choice is proposal 1, which offers the lowest fare and driver fee combination with a significant reduction in transit time. Proposal 8 is next, as it maintains a low fare and driver fee with improved transit times. Proposal 3 is chosen for its balance of moderate fare and driver fee with good transit time reduction. Proposal 10 offers a moderate fare and driver fee with a reasonable transit time improvement. Finally, proposal 19 is selected for its balance of moderate fare and driver fee with a significant reduction in transit time."
