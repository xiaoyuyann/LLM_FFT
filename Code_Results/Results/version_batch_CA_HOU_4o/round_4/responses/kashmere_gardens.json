    "disposable_income": "Kashmere Gardens has a relatively low average disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kashmere Gardens have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited access to resources and services, with many residents relying on public transit due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize costs for residents while improving transit accessibility. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to avoid further financial strain on residents. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized."
