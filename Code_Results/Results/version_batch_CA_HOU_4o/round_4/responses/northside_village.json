    "disposable_income": "Northside Village has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community prioritizes essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current services are often slow and less frequent, making accessibility to jobs and services challenging.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low to moderate disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and minimal driver fees are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. Improving transit times is also crucial to enhance accessibility. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax, which also offer reduced travel times, are prioritized."
