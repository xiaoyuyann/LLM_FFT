    "disposable_income": "The Mid-West neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in professional sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood's high car ownership means that driver fees should be considered carefully to avoid excessive burden. A balanced approach with moderate sales tax and driver fees, along with improved transit times, would be ideal. Therefore, proposals with a 1% sales tax, moderate driver fees, and reduced transit times are prioritized. The top choice is proposal 11, which offers a good balance of reduced travel times for both car and transit, with a reasonable fare and fee structure. Proposal 10 is similar but with slightly longer transit times. Proposal 3 offers a lower sales tax but still improves transit times. Proposal 19 and 20, with a higher sales tax, are considered for their significant reduction in transit times, which could benefit those who rely on public transportation."
