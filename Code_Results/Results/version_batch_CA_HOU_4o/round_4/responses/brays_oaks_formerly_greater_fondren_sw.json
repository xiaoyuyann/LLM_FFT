    "disposable_income": "Brays Oaks has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Brays Oaks have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of services and employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and improve accessibility. The top-ranked proposals balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both transit and driving."
