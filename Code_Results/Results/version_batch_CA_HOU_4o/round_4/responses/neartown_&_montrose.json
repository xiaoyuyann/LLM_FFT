    "disposable_income": "Neartown / Montrose is known for its relatively high disposable income due to a mix of professionals and affluent residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a vibrant cultural and dining scene, indicating high discretionary consumption on entertainment and dining.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and walkability, but traffic congestion can be an issue.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher fares and fees if it results in better transit services and reduced congestion. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The top-ranked proposals balance lower transit fares and moderate driver fees to encourage transit use while maintaining reasonable costs for drivers. The goal is to improve transit times and reduce car travel times, benefiting both transit users and drivers."
