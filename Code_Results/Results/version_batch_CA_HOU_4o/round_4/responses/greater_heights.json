    "disposable_income": "Greater Heights is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Heights tend to have higher discretionary spending on dining, entertainment, and other lifestyle activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving overall transit service quality. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, which offer significant reductions in travel times, are prioritized."
