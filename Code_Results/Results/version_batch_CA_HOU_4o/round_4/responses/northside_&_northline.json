    "disposable_income": "The Northside / Northline neighborhood has a relatively lower disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but improvements could significantly benefit residents who rely on it for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it's crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, reducing travel times and potentially encouraging a shift from driving to transit, which could alleviate congestion and reduce emissions."
