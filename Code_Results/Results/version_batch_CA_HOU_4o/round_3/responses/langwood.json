    "disposable_income": "Langwood is a working-class neighborhood with relatively low to moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Langwood have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Langwood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit coverage and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and lower overall transportation costs. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while not imposing excessive taxes or fees."
