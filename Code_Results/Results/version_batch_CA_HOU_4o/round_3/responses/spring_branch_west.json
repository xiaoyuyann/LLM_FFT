    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch West has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch West have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs manageable for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can reduce travel times and improve accessibility. The selected policies aim to balance cost, accessibility, and service improvement, considering the neighborhood's reliance on both transit and driving."
