    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for East Houston, as many residents rely on it for commuting to work and accessing essential services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower fare and driving fee are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Additionally, a moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents depend on public transportation. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, reducing travel times and encouraging a shift from driving to transit, which can alleviate congestion and emissions."
