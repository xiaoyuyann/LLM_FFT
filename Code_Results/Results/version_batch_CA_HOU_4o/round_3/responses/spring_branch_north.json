    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch North has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with residents spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch North has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it improves transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs while maintaining accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized."
