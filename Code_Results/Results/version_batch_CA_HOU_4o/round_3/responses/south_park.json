    "disposable_income": "South Park has a relatively low disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in South Park have limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "South Park has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income in South Park, minimizing costs for both transit and driving is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to ensure affordability. Additionally, reducing travel time is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, along with reduced travel times, are ranked higher. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' limited discretionary spending."
