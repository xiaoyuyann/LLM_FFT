    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch Central has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch Central have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and limited luxury spending.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit, though transit options could be improved.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening residents financially. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel times is also a priority to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales taxes that offer reduced travel times are prioritized."
