    "disposable_income": "Willow Meadows / Willowbend is a middle-income neighborhood with moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low while improving transit times. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit service. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while ensuring the neighborhood's budget is not overly strained."
