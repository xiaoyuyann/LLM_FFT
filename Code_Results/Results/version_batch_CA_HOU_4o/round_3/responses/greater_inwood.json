    "disposable_income": "Greater Inwood has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income households and some lower-income residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Inwood have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some capacity for leisure and non-essential spending.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit, though transit times are currently longer than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening residents financially. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel times is crucial for both modes to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals that offer reduced travel times and reasonable costs are prioritized. Proposals with a $0.75 fare and moderate driver fees are preferred, as they offer a good balance of cost and improved transit times, while a 1% sales tax is acceptable to support better services."
