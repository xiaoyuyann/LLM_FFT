    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor / Port Houston has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income, it is crucial to minimize costs associated with both transit fares and driving fees. A lower sales tax is also preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate improvements in transit times, are prioritized. The community benefits from reduced travel times, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. The selected proposals balance affordability with improved transit service, encouraging a shift from driving to transit where feasible."
