    "disposable_income": "Westbranch has a moderate level of disposable income, with residents having some flexibility in their spending but still being sensitive to significant increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbranch tend to have moderate discretionary consumption, balancing between essential expenses and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Westbranch has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and public transit, though transit times are currently longer than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, Westbranch residents would benefit from policies that reduce transit costs and improve service efficiency without significantly increasing overall expenses. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The top choices balance cost savings, improved transit times, and manageable tax rates."
