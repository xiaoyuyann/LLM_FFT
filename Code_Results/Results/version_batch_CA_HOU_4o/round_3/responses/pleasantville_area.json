    "disposable_income": "Pleasantville Area has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current services are limited, leading to longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to keep transit fares and driver fees low to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also preferred to maintain affordability of other goods and services. However, improving transit times is crucial for accessibility, so a balance must be struck between cost and service improvement. Proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate tax rates, and improved transit times are prioritized to enhance accessibility while keeping costs manageable."
