    "disposable_income": "The South Acres / Crestmont Park neighborhood generally has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary income available for non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and costs could significantly benefit residents who rely on these services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to prioritize policies that minimize costs for residents while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also offer reduced travel times, are prioritized. The balance between cost savings and improved transit times is key to supporting the community's needs."
