    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Carverdale have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Carverdale has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit coverage and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Carverdale's moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens while improving transit accessibility. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting residents' budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as improved transit can reduce reliance on personal vehicles, saving costs in the long run. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales taxes are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements."
