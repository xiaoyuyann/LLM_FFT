    "disposable_income": "Lazybrook / Timbergrove is a middle to upper-middle-class neighborhood with relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lazybrook / Timbergrove have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, leisure, and home improvement.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making driving a common choice for residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can reduce congestion and emissions. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax, that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
