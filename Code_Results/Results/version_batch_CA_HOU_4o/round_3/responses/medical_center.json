    "disposable_income": "The Medical Center neighborhood has a relatively high disposable income due to the presence of healthcare professionals and researchers.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Medical Center area have moderate to high discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and healthcare services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a strong reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles due to the high density of medical facilities and employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing travel time for both transit and driving, as well as maintaining a reasonable cost structure. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax, which also offer reduced travel times, are prioritized."
