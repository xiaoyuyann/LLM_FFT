    "disposable_income": "Westchase has a moderate to high disposable income level, with many residents employed in professional and managerial positions.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westchase have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "Westchase has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making driving a common choice.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Westchase residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The community values efficient transportation, so proposals that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial, as residents are sensitive to increased costs that could impact their discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with moderate tax rates and improved transit times are preferred, as they offer a good compromise between cost and service enhancement."
