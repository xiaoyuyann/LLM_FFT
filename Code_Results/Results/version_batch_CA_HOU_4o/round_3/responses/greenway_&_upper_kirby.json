    "disposable_income": "Greenway / Upper Kirby is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greenway / Upper Kirby tend to have higher discretionary spending on luxury goods, dining, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better service and reduced travel times. A moderate sales tax is acceptable to support transit improvements. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as maintaining a balance between cost and service quality. Proposals with a $0.75 transit fare and moderate driver fees are preferred, as they offer improved transit times without significantly impacting discretionary spending. A 1% sales tax is a reasonable compromise to enhance transit services without overly burdening residents."
