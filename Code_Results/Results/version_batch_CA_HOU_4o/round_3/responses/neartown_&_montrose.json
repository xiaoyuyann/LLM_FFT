    "disposable_income": "Neartown / Montrose is known for its relatively high disposable income due to a mix of professionals and affluent residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a vibrant cultural and dining scene, indicating high discretionary consumption on entertainment, dining, and arts.",
    "accessibility": "Neartown / Montrose has good accessibility with multiple transit options and is pedestrian-friendly, but traffic congestion can be an issue.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher fares and taxes if it results in better transit services and reduced congestion. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency. A moderate increase in sales tax and driver fees is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times and reduces car travel time. The top choices reflect a balance between cost and improved service, prioritizing options that reduce transit time and encourage a shift from driving to transit."
