    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Museum Park have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on cultural, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Museum Park has good accessibility to resources and services, with multiple transit options and proximity to major city attractions.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency, as many residents rely on public transportation for commuting to cultural and recreational activities. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, but the priority is on reducing travel times and improving service quality. Therefore, proposals with lower travel times and moderate costs are prioritized."
