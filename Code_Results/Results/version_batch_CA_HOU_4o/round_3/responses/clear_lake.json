    "disposable_income": "Clear Lake is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Clear Lake have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Clear Lake has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options, though transit times are currently longer.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, Clear Lake residents can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significantly improved transit services. The community values reduced travel times and improved transit efficiency, which can also alleviate congestion. Therefore, proposals that balance a moderate tax increase with reduced travel times and improved transit services are prioritized. Proposals with a higher driver fee are less favored as many residents rely on personal vehicles. The top choices reflect a balance between cost and improved service, aiming to enhance overall accessibility and reduce travel times."
