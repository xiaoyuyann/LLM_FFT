    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to ensure affordability. Additionally, reducing travel time is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, proposals with a moderate sales tax, lower fares, and driving fees that also offer reduced travel times are prioritized. This approach aims to enhance transit services without significantly impacting residents' financial stability."
