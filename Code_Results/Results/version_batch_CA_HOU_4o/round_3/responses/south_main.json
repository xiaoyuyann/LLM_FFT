    "disposable_income": "South Main has a moderate disposable income level, with residents having some flexibility in their spending but still sensitive to significant increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in South Main allocate a fair portion of their income to discretionary spending, including dining, entertainment, and retail, which could be impacted by higher taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "South Main has decent access to public transit and road networks, but improvements in transit times could significantly enhance accessibility for residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A balanced approach with a moderate sales tax ensures transit improvements without overly burdening residents' discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and a balanced tax rate are prioritized."
