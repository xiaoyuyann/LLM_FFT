    "disposable_income": "Downtown residents generally have a higher disposable income due to a concentration of professionals and businesses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a high level of discretionary consumption with numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options.",
    "accessibility": "Downtown has excellent accessibility to resources and services, with a robust public transit network and walkable infrastructure.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, Downtown residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing congestion and improving transit efficiency, as many residents rely on public transportation. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it enhances transit services, but the priority is on reducing travel times and improving service quality. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
