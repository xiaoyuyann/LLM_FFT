    "disposable_income": "Kingwood is a relatively affluent neighborhood with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kingwood have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and other non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Kingwood has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Kingwood's higher disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. A moderate increase in sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as the community can absorb this cost. However, keeping driving fees low is important to avoid burdening residents who primarily use cars. Therefore, proposals that balance improved transit times with minimal cost increases are prioritized."
