    "disposable_income": "El Dorado / Oates Prairie has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income spent on essentials like housing and food.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Additionally, reducing travel time is crucial to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and reduced travel times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents' consumption of other goods and services."
