    "disposable_income": "Braeswood is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood with a relatively high level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Braeswood have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Braeswood has decent accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit and driving options, though driving is often preferred due to convenience.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the relatively high disposable income, Braeswood residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The community values efficient transportation, so proposals that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial, as residents are willing to pay slightly higher taxes for better transit services. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, coupled with improved travel times, are preferred."
