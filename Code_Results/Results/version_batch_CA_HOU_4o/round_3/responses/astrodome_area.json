    "disposable_income": "The Astrodome Area has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income households and some lower-income residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Astrodome Area have a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has decent accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs manageable for both transit users and drivers. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The top-ranked proposals balance lower fares and driver fees with improved transit times, while keeping the sales tax at a reasonable level to not overly burden residents' discretionary spending."
