    "disposable_income": "Eldridge / West Oaks is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Eldridge / West Oaks have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, dining, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on personal vehicles due to limited public transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significantly improved transit services. The neighborhood's reliance on cars suggests that reducing driving time is also a priority. Therefore, proposals that balance a reasonable sales tax with reduced travel times for both transit and driving are preferred. Proposals with a higher driver fee are less favorable due to the community's reliance on personal vehicles. The top-ranked proposals offer a balance of improved transit times and moderate costs, aligning with the community's ability to absorb slight increases in expenses while benefiting from enhanced transportation services."
