    "disposable_income": "The Jensen neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs and relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jensen prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary income for non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Jensen has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the limited reach and frequency of transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to keep transportation costs low while improving transit efficiency. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without significantly impacting residents' budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as this can reduce reliance on personal vehicles and improve overall accessibility. The selected policies balance cost, travel time, and service improvement, prioritizing affordability and efficiency for the community."
