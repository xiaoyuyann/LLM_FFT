    "disposable_income": "Central Southwest has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community prioritizes essential spending, with limited room for increased transportation costs impacting other areas of consumption.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for many residents, but current services are less efficient, leading to longer travel times compared to driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, policies with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Improved transit times are crucial, so options that significantly reduce transit times without drastically increasing costs are prioritized. Balancing these factors, proposals that offer a good compromise between cost and improved transit efficiency are ranked higher."
