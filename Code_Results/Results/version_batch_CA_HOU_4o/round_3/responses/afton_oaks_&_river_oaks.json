    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a preference for driving due to convenience and lifestyle choices.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and preference for driving, the community would likely prioritize policies that maintain or improve driving conditions while supporting transit improvements. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize impact on discretionary spending. A moderate driving fee is acceptable if it significantly reduces congestion and improves transit times, as this could enhance overall quality of life. Therefore, policies with a balance of moderate taxes, reasonable driving fees, and improved transit times are prioritized."
