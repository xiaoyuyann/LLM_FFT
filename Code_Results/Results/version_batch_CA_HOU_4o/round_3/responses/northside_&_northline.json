    "disposable_income": "The Northside / Northline neighborhood has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is crucial to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Additionally, improving transit times is important to enhance accessibility and encourage public transit use. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, along with reduced travel times, are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents' discretionary spending."
