    "disposable_income": "Memorial is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Memorial have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility by car, but public transit options are less convenient and less frequently used.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services. However, the community values convenience and time savings, so policies that reduce travel time are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce congestion and improve overall quality of life. The top-ranked policies balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and reasonable costs, while also considering the potential for improved transit services."
