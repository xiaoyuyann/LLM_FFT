    "disposable_income": "Northside Village has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Northside Village has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on cars due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as better transit can reduce reliance on cars, saving money in the long run. The selected policies aim to balance cost savings with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both transit and driving."
