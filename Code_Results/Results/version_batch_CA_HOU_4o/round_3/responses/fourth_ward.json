    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary consumption, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. Additionally, improving transit times is crucial for accessibility, so policies that reduce travel time are prioritized. A balance between sales tax and service improvement is necessary, with a slight preference for lower taxes to avoid significant impacts on consumption. The selected policies aim to enhance transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for residents."
