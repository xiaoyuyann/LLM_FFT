    "disposable_income": "Harrisburg / Manchester has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs for both transit and driving is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to ensure affordability. The community benefits from improved transit times, which can enhance accessibility and reduce reliance on personal vehicles. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' limited discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate improvements in travel times, are prioritized."
