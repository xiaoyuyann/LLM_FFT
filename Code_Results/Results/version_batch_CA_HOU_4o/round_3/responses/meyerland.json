    "disposable_income": "Meyerland is a middle to upper-middle-class neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Meyerland have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on housing, education, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Meyerland has decent accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of car and transit options, though car travel is more prevalent due to convenience and speed.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Meyerland's higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can alleviate congestion. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales taxes, that offer significant reductions in travel times are prioritized."
