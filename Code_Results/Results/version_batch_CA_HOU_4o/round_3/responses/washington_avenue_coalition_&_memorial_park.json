    "disposable_income": "The Washington Avenue Coalition / Memorial Park area generally has a higher disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have higher discretionary spending, often on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, but traffic congestion can be an issue.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better service and reduced congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency, as many residents value time savings and convenience. Therefore, proposals that offer reduced travel times for both transit and driving, even with slightly higher costs, are prioritized. The top choices balance improved transit times with reasonable costs, considering the community's ability to absorb these costs without significantly impacting their discretionary spending."
