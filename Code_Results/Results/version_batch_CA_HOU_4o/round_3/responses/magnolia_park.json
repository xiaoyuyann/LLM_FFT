    "disposable_income": "Magnolia Park has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Magnolia Park have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the limited reach and frequency of transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial for residents. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to reduce daily expenses. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and lower overall transportation costs. The focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit efficiency to enhance accessibility without imposing a heavy financial burden."
