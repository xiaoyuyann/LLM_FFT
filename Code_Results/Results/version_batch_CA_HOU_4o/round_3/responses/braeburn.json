    "disposable_income": "Braeburn has a moderate to low disposable income level, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Braeburn have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Braeburn has moderate accessibility to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the area and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income in Braeburn, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve discretionary spending. However, improving transit times is crucial to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion. Therefore, the top-ranked policies balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both driving and public transit."
