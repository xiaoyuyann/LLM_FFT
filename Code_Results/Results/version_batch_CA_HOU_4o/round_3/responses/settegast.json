    "disposable_income": "Settegast has a relatively low disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Settegast have limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Settegast has limited access to public transportation, making car travel a necessity for many residents, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit could reduce reliance on cars and improve accessibility. The selected policies balance affordability with potential improvements in transit efficiency and accessibility."
