    "disposable_income": "East Little York / Homestead has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current transit times are long, and accessibility to resources and services is limited.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, affordability of transit fares and driver fees is crucial. Reducing transit times is also important to improve accessibility. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate sales tax, and reduced travel times are prioritized. Proposal 8 offers a balance with a low fare, moderate tax, and reduced travel times. Proposal 11 further reduces travel times with a slightly higher fare. Proposal 1 offers the lowest fare and fee with reduced travel times. Proposal 10 balances a moderate fare and tax with improved travel times. Proposal 19 offers a moderate fare and tax with significant travel time reductions."
