    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch East has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with residents spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch East has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs manageable for both transit users and drivers. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use while not overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can benefit the community by reducing congestion and improving accessibility. The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and service improvement, considering the neighborhood's reliance on both transit and driving."
