    "accessibility": "Westwood has moderate accessibility to resources, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax rates that offer reduced travel times, are prioritized."
