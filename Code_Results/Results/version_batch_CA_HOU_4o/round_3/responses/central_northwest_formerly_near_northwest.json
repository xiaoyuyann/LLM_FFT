    "disposable_income": "The Central Northwest neighborhood has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and working-class families.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Central Northwest tend to have moderate discretionary spending, balancing essential expenses with some leisure and non-essential purchases.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the spread-out nature of services and employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, improving transit service, and minimizing the financial impact on residents."
