    "disposable_income": "The Jensen super neighborhood has a relatively low disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jensen have limited discretionary consumption, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Jensen has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are prioritized to ensure affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. The selected policies balance these factors by offering lower fares and fees while maintaining or slightly increasing the sales tax to enhance transit services."
