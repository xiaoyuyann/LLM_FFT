    "disposable_income": "El Dorado / Oates Prairie has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit options, making car travel a necessity for many residents, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this could benefit those who rely on public transportation. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while not overly increasing the sales tax burden."
