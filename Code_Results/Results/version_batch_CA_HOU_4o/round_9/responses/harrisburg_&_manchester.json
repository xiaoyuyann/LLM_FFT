    "disposable_income": "Harrisburg / Manchester has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income spent on essentials like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with public transit being a crucial mode of transportation for many residents due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are preferred to minimize financial burden. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services, as this can benefit the community by reducing travel times and improving accessibility."
