    "disposable_income": "Braeswood is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Braeswood have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Braeswood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making driving a common mode of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the relatively high disposable income and discretionary consumption, Braeswood residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better transit services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood's good accessibility by car suggests that policies reducing car travel time and improving transit efficiency would be beneficial. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax, lower transit fares, and moderate driving fees are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving while maintaining affordability."
