    "disposable_income": "Independence Heights has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community prioritizes essential spending, with limited discretionary income for non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current transit times are long, and car ownership is lower than in other neighborhoods.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs for both transit and driving is important. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to ensure affordability. The community would benefit from improved transit times, so proposals that reduce travel time are favored. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected proposals balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on public transit and limited discretionary income."
