    "disposable_income": "Westbranch has a moderate level of disposable income, with residents generally able to afford basic necessities but being cautious about additional expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbranch tend to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Westbranch has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and public transit, though transit times are currently longer.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance costs with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. The top choices prioritize reducing transit times and maintaining affordability for both transit users and drivers, while also considering the potential for reduced congestion and emissions."
