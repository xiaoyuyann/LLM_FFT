    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a high level of discretionary consumption with numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options.",
    "accessibility": "Downtown has excellent accessibility to resources and services, with robust public transit options and walkability, but also experiences significant traffic congestion.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Downtown residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better service and reduced congestion. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit service, as many residents rely on public transportation. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate fares, driver fees, and sales tax, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized."
