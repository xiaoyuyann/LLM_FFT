    "disposable_income": "Westbury has a moderate disposable income level, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbury have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Westbury has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Westbury's moderate income levels, it is important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening residents financially. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times and accessibility. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while ensuring that the financial impact on residents is manageable. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
