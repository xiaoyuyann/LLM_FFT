    "disposable_income": "Sharpstown has a moderate to low disposable income level, with many residents working in service and retail sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Sharpstown tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Sharpstown has moderate accessibility to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the area and the need to access jobs and services across the city.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Sharpstown's moderate to low disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve discretionary spending. However, improving transit times is crucial to enhance accessibility and reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Therefore, proposals that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. The top-ranked proposals offer reduced travel times for both transit and driving, with manageable costs, thus providing a balanced approach to improving transportation without significantly impacting residents' financial stability."
