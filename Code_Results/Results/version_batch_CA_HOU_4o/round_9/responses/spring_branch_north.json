    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch North has a moderate disposable income level, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch North has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and fees while considering the impact of sales tax on overall consumption. Proposals that offer significant reductions in travel time are also prioritized to enhance accessibility and convenience for residents."
