    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch Central has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with residents spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch Central has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage public transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while ensuring the community can still afford other essential goods and services."
