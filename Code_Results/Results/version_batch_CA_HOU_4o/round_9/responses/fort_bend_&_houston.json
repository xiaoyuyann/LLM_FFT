    "disposable_income": "Fort Bend / Houston has a moderate to high disposable income level, with many residents having the financial flexibility to absorb slight increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a diverse range of discretionary spending habits, with a significant portion of income allocated to housing, education, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has decent accessibility to resources and services, but improvements in transit times could enhance connectivity and reduce reliance on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it results in significant improvements in transit times. Reducing transit times is crucial for enhancing accessibility and encouraging a shift from driving to public transit, which can alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized, as they offer a balance between cost and improved service. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as the community can absorb this cost without significantly impacting discretionary consumption."
