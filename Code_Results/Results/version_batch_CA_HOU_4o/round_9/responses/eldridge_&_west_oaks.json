    "disposable_income": "Eldridge / West Oaks is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Eldridge / West Oaks have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, dining, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on personal vehicles due to limited public transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both driving and transit, as well as improving transit service quality to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which could alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, that offer significant reductions in travel times are prioritized."
