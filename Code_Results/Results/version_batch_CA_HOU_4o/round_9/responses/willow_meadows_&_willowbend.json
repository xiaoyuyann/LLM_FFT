    "disposable_income": "Willow Meadows / Willowbend is a middle-income neighborhood with moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on essentials and some luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to maintain affordability. The neighborhood benefits from reduced travel times, so proposals that decrease travel time for both modes are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit service, as it can encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower fares, moderate sales tax, and reduced travel times are ranked higher."
