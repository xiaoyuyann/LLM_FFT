    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake Houston have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. However, a balance must be struck to ensure that the cost does not overly burden those who rely on driving. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to public transit, which can alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax and driving fees, coupled with reduced travel times, are prioritized."
