    "disposable_income": "Neartown / Montrose is a relatively affluent area with a higher-than-average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Neartown / Montrose tend to have higher discretionary spending on dining, entertainment, and cultural activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and walkable areas, but still relies significantly on car travel.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which aligns with the neighborhood's environmental consciousness and desire for efficient transportation."
