    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for East Houston, as many residents rely on it for commuting to work and accessing essential services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. However, improving transit times is also crucial as many residents rely on public transportation. A balance between lower fares and reasonable travel times is necessary. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use while keeping costs manageable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can enhance accessibility and reduce travel times."
