    "disposable_income": "Westchase is a mixed-income area with a significant portion of middle-income residents, providing moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westchase have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, dining, and entertainment being significant.",
    "accessibility": "Westchase has good accessibility to resources and services, with a well-connected road network and moderate public transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel times is also a priority to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable travel times are prioritized."
