    "disposable_income": "The Greater Fifth Ward has a relatively low average disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Greater Fifth Ward have limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a significant portion of residents relying on public transit due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and reliance on public transit, the Greater Fifth Ward would benefit from policies that reduce transit fares and improve transit service times. A lower sales tax is also preferable to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times without significantly increasing costs, are prioritized. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced transit times and fares, while keeping the sales tax and driver fees at manageable levels."
