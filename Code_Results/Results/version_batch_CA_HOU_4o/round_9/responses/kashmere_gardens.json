    "disposable_income": "Kashmere Gardens has a relatively low average disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kashmere Gardens have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited access to resources and services, with many residents relying on public transit due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and reliance on public transit, it is crucial to prioritize policies that minimize costs for transit users while improving service efficiency. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fees can encourage more people to use public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents' limited discretionary spending. Therefore, the selected policies focus on balancing lower transit fares and reasonable driver fees with moderate sales taxes to enhance transit accessibility and affordability."
