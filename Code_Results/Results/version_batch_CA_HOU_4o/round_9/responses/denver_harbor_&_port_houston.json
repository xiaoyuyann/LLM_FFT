    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor / Port Houston has a relatively low to moderate disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the limited reach and frequency of transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit can reduce reliance on cars, saving money in the long run. The selected policies aim to balance cost savings with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both driving and public transit."
