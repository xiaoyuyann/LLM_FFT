    "disposable_income": "Acres Home has a relatively low median household income compared to other Houston neighborhoods, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Acres Home have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Acres Home has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, the community would benefit from policies that reduce transit fares and driving fees while maintaining or slightly increasing the sales tax to improve transit services. Lower fares and fees would make transit more affordable and encourage a shift from driving, reducing congestion and emissions. The selected policies balance affordability with improved transit times, considering the community's financial constraints and need for better transit access."
