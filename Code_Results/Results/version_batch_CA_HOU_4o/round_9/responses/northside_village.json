    "accessibility": "Northside Village has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and driving fees are prioritized. Additionally, reducing travel time is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate sales tax rates are preferred to ensure adequate funding for transit improvements without overly burdening residents. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel time while keeping costs manageable for both transit users and drivers."
