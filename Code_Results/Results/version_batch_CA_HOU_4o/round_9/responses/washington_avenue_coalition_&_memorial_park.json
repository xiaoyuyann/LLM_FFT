    "disposable_income": "The Washington Avenue Coalition / Memorial Park area generally has a higher disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have higher discretionary spending, often on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on balancing the cost of transit and driving with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved service. Proposals with moderate sales tax rates are preferred to avoid excessive impact on discretionary spending. The top-ranked proposals offer a good balance of reduced travel times for both transit and driving, with reasonable costs."
