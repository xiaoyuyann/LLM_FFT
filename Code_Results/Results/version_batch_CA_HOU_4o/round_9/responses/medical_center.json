    "disposable_income": "The Medical Center neighborhood has a relatively high disposable income due to the presence of healthcare professionals and researchers.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Medical Center area have moderate to high discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and healthcare services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a strong reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles due to the presence of the Texas Medical Center.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on improving transit times to support the large number of healthcare workers who rely on public transportation. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing transit travel time and maintaining a balance between fare, tax, and driving fee to ensure affordability and improved service."
