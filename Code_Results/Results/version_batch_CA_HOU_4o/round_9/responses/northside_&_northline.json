    "disposable_income": "The Northside / Northline neighborhood generally has a lower disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred. However, improving transit times is also important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with a moderate sales tax and lower fares and fees are prioritized to ensure affordability while improving transit services. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while not significantly increasing the financial burden through taxes."
