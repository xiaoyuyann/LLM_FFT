    "disposable_income": "Greater Uptown is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Uptown have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, dining, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, but traffic congestion can be an issue.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it enhances transit infrastructure. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving service quality, as residents value time efficiency. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate taxes, reasonable fares, and driver fees that lead to reduced travel times are prioritized."
