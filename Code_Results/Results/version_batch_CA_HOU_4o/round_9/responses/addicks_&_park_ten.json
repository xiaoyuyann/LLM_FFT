    "disposable_income": "The Addicks / Park Ten neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in the energy sector and related industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on housing, dining, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax or transit fare if it results in significantly improved transit services. The neighborhood's reliance on both driving and transit means that reducing travel times for both modes is important. Proposals that balance lower transit fares with moderate driver fees and sales taxes are preferred, as they encourage transit use while not overly burdening drivers. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing travel times and costs for transit users, as this can lead to a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
