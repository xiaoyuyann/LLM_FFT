    "disposable_income": "Lazybrook / Timbergrove is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood with relatively high disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lazybrook / Timbergrove have moderate to high discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, leisure, and home improvements.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, while keeping costs reasonable. Proposals with a balance of lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax, which improve transit times significantly, are prioritized."
