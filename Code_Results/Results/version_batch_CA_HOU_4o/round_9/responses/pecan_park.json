    "accessibility": "Pecan Park has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with many residents relying on public transit due to limited car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep transit fares and driving fees affordable to ensure accessibility. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The focus is on improving transit times to make public transportation a more viable option, while also considering the potential benefits of reduced congestion and emissions. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also offer significant reductions in travel time, are prioritized."
