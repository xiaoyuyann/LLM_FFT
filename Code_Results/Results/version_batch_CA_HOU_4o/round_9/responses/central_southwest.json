    "disposable_income": "Central Southwest has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Central Southwest tend to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary income for non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and driving fee would benefit residents who rely on both modes of transportation. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce travel times and improve accessibility. The top-ranked proposals balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both driving and public transit."
