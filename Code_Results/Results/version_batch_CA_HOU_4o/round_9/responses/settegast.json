    "disposable_income": "Settegast has a relatively low disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Settegast have limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Settegast has limited access to public transportation, making car travel a necessity for many residents, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income in Settegast, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit could provide more accessibility for residents without cars. The focus is on balancing cost savings with improved transit times to enhance accessibility without imposing high costs on residents."
