    "disposable_income": "The Central Northwest neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Central Northwest have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and limited luxury spending.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, it is important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it results in better transit services, as this can improve accessibility and reduce travel times. The selected policies prioritize reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while considering the financial impact on residents."
