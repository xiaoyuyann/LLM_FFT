    "disposable_income": "Midtown residents generally have a moderate to high disposable income, with a mix of young professionals and established residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has a vibrant lifestyle with a high level of discretionary consumption on dining, entertainment, and cultural activities.",
    "accessibility": "Midtown has good accessibility to public transit options, with several bus and light rail lines, but also experiences significant traffic congestion for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better transit services and reduced congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency, which aligns with the neighborhood's reliance on both public transit and driving. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
