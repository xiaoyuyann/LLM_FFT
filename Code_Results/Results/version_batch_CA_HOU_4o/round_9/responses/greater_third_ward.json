    "disposable_income": "The Greater Third Ward has a relatively lower disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Greater Third Ward have limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels, making cost-sensitive policies more favorable.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a significant portion of residents relying on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to ensure affordability and improved transit services. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The top-ranked policies balance reduced travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while also considering the potential for reduced congestion and emissions."
