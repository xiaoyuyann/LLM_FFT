    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch East has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has a diverse range of discretionary consumption patterns, with residents spending on essentials and some luxury goods, but generally being price-sensitive.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch East has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents, while moderate sales tax rates are acceptable if they significantly improve transit efficiency. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and fees with reasonable travel time reductions, ensuring affordability and accessibility for the community."
