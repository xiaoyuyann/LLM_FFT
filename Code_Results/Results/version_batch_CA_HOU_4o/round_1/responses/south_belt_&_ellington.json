    "disposable_income": "The South Belt / Ellington neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in middle-income jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can enhance accessibility and reduce congestion. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and fees while considering the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services."
