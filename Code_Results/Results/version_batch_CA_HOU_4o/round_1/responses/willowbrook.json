    "disposable_income": "Willowbrook has a moderate disposable income level, with residents having some flexibility in their spending but still being sensitive to significant increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Willowbrook tend to have moderate discretionary consumption, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Willowbrook has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and transit, though transit times are currently longer than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, it is important to balance cost increases with improvements in service. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing transit times and maintaining reasonable costs for both transit users and drivers, while also considering the impact of sales tax on overall consumption."
