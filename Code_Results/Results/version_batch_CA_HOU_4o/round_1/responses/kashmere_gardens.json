    "disposable_income": "Kashmere Gardens has a relatively low average disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kashmere Gardens have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are prioritized to reduce costs for both transit users and drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit can reduce reliance on driving and improve accessibility. The selected policies aim to balance cost savings with improved transit efficiency, considering the neighborhood's financial constraints and transportation needs."
