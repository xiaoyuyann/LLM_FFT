    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch Central has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch Central have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and fees while considering the impact of sales tax on overall consumption. Proposals that offer significant reductions in travel time are also prioritized to improve accessibility and quality of life for residents."
