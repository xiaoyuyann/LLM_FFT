    "disposable_income": "Museum Park is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income, allowing for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Museum Park have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on cultural, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Museum Park has good accessibility to resources and services, with multiple transit options and proximity to major roads, but improvements in transit efficiency could enhance connectivity further.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, Museum Park can accommodate a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significant improvements in transit efficiency and reduced travel times. The community values reduced congestion and environmental benefits, so policies that encourage a shift from driving to transit are favorable. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and moderate costs, while also considering the impact of sales tax on discretionary spending."
