    "accessibility": "Public transit options are limited, and many residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, policies with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize financial burden. However, improving transit accessibility is crucial for those without cars. Balancing these needs, proposals with moderate taxes and fares, and reasonable driving fees that improve transit times are prioritized. The goal is to enhance transit services without significantly increasing costs for residents."
