    "disposable_income": "The Addicks / Park Ten neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in the energy sector and related industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and travel.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options, though transit times are currently longer.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax or transit fare if it results in significantly improved transit times. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency, as many residents commute to work. A balance between fare, tax, and driving fees is crucial to ensure that both drivers and transit users benefit. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driving fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while a moderate sales tax is acceptable to support transit improvements."
