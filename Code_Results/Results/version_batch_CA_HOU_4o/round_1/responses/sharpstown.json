    "disposable_income": "Sharpstown has a moderate to low disposable income level, with many residents working in service and retail sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Sharpstown tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Sharpstown has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Sharpstown's moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times is also important to enhance accessibility and convenience. Balancing these factors, the selected proposals aim to provide cost-effective and efficient transportation options for Sharpstown residents."
