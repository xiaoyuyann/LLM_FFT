    "disposable_income": "The South Acres / Crestmont Park neighborhood generally has a lower to moderate disposable income level.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing more on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of services and employment opportunities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower to moderate disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and lower overall transportation costs. The top-ranked proposals balance these considerations by offering reduced travel times and costs, while not overly increasing the sales tax burden."
