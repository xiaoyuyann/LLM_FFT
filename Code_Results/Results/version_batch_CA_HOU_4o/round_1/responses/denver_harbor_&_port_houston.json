    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor / Port Houston has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income spent on essentials like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens while improving transit efficiency. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to avoid significant impacts on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also offer reduced travel times, are prioritized. The balance between cost and improved transit service is key to supporting the community's needs."
