    "disposable_income": "Fondren Gardens has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Fondren Gardens tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of services and employment opportunities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. Additionally, reducing travel times is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax rates that still improve transit times, are prioritized. The top choices reflect a balance between affordability and improved transit service, considering the community's reliance on both transit and personal vehicles."
