    "disposable_income": "Westchase has a moderate to high disposable income due to a mix of residential and commercial areas, with many professionals and businesses located in the area.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westchase have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, with access to various shopping, dining, and entertainment options.",
    "accessibility": "Westchase has good accessibility to resources and services, with major highways and public transit options available, though transit times are longer compared to driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Westchase residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit times. The community values efficient transportation to support its business and residential needs. Therefore, proposals that reduce travel time significantly, even with higher fares and fees, are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it supports better transit services. The top-ranked proposals balance reduced travel times with reasonable costs, considering the community's ability to absorb these costs without significantly impacting discretionary spending."
