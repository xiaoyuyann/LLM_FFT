    "disposable_income": "The IAH Airport super neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in airport-related jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is moderate, with spending focused on essential goods and services due to the working-class nature of the community.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to the airport and surrounding commercial areas, but public transit options are limited, making driving a common choice.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. Reducing travel time is also crucial due to the reliance on driving. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax, which improve transit times without significantly increasing costs, are prioritized. The community would benefit from improved transit services to reduce reliance on driving, but not at the expense of high costs. Balancing these factors, proposals with a 0.5% or 1% sales tax, lower fares, and moderate driving fees are preferred to ensure affordability and improved transit times."
