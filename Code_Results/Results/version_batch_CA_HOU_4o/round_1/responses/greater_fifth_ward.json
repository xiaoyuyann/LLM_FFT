    "disposable_income": "The Greater Fifth Ward has a relatively low average disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Greater Fifth Ward have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on it due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, minimizing costs for residents is crucial. Lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs while ensuring that any increase in sales tax is justified by improved transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax rates, are prioritized to balance affordability and service improvement."
