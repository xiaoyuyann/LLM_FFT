    "disposable_income": "The Washington Avenue Coalition / Memorial Park area generally has a higher disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have higher discretionary spending, often on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The focus is on balancing improved transit services with reasonable costs. Lowering travel times is a priority, as it enhances convenience and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax, lower transit fares, and moderate driver fees are preferred to ensure improved transit services without significantly impacting discretionary spending."
