    "disposable_income": "Westbranch has a moderate level of disposable income, with residents generally able to afford basic necessities and some discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbranch have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on both essential and non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Westbranch has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving to avoid burdening residents financially. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to maintain affordability. The sales tax should be balanced to ensure adequate funding for transit improvements without significantly impacting discretionary spending. Proposals that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are prioritized to improve accessibility and convenience. Therefore, options with lower fares and fees, moderate sales tax, and reduced travel times are ranked higher."
