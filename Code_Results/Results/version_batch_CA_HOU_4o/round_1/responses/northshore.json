    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. Additionally, improving transit times is important to enhance accessibility and reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax rates that improve transit times, are prioritized. The selected proposals aim to provide better transit services while keeping costs manageable for residents."
