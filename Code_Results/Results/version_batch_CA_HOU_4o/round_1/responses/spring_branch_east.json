    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch East has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and working-class residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has a diverse range of discretionary consumption patterns, with residents spending on essentials and some discretionary items, but with a focus on affordability.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch East has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit, though transit options could be improved for better connectivity.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening residents financially. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times and services. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while ensuring that the financial impact on residents is manageable. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
