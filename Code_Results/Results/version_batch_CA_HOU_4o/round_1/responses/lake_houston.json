    "disposable_income": "Lake Houston is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake Houston have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significant improvements in transit service and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing car travel time and improving transit efficiency to encourage a shift from driving to public transit, which can alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial, as a higher tax could impact discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with moderate taxes, lower fares, and higher driving fees are prioritized to enhance transit services while managing costs."
