    "disposable_income": "Neartown / Montrose is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Neartown / Montrose tend to have higher discretionary spending on dining, entertainment, and cultural activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good access to public transit and is walkable, with many amenities and services within a short distance.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving overall transit service quality. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, which offer significant reductions in travel time, are prioritized."
