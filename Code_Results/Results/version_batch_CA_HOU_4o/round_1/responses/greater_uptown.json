    "disposable_income": "Greater Uptown is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Uptown have significant discretionary spending, often on luxury goods, dining, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, but traffic congestion is a concern.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it leads to better services and reduced congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can alleviate congestion. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
