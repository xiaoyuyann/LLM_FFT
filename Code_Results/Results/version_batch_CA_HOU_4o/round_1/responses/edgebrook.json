    "disposable_income": "Edgebrook has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Edgebrook have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Edgebrook has moderate accessibility to resources, with some reliance on public transit and a significant number of residents using personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Additionally, reducing travel time is crucial to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, along with reduced travel times, are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents' consumption of essential goods."
