    "disposable_income": "The Northside / Northline neighborhood generally has a lower to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing more on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to public transit, but many residents rely on cars due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel time is also important to improve access to jobs and services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate taxes, and reduced travel times are prioritized."
