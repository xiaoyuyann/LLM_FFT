    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch North has a moderate disposable income level, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch North have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, it is important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage public transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The decision aims to enhance transit accessibility while maintaining affordability for residents."
