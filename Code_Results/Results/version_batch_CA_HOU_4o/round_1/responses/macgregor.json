    "disposable_income": "MacGregor has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in MacGregor have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "MacGregor has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and reliability could significantly benefit the community, as many residents rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while ensuring that the financial burden on residents is manageable. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that also reduce travel times are prioritized."
