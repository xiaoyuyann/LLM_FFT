    "disposable_income": "Clear Lake is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Clear Lake have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Clear Lake has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options, though transit times are currently longer.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, Clear Lake residents can absorb moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significantly improved transit times. The community values reduced travel times and improved transit services, which can be achieved by policies that balance fare, tax, and fee structures. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending, while moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees are acceptable if they lead to reduced congestion and faster transit times. Therefore, proposals that offer a balance between these factors, with a focus on reducing travel times and improving transit service, are prioritized."
