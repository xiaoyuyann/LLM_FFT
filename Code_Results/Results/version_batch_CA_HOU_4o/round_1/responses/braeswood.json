    "disposable_income": "Braeswood is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood, with residents having a moderate to high level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Braeswood have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Braeswood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Braeswood residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood values efficient transportation options, so proposals that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are prioritized. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial, as residents are willing to pay slightly higher taxes if it leads to better transit services. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax, reduced travel times, and reasonable fare and fee structures are preferred."
