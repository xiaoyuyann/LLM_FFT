    "disposable_income": "Greater Heights is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Heights have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and other lifestyle activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making both driving and public transit viable options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on balancing cost with improved transit efficiency and reduced congestion. Proposals with moderate fares and driver fees, coupled with lower sales taxes, are prioritized to ensure affordability while enhancing transit service quality."
