    "disposable_income": "Westwood has a moderate to low disposable income level, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westwood have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Westwood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the area and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and lower overall transportation costs. The top-ranked proposals balance these considerations by offering reduced travel times and costs, both for transit and driving, without imposing high fares or fees."
