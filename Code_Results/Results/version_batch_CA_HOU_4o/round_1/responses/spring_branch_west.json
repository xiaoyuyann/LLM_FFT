    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch West has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and working-class families.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch West have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and limited luxury spending.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit, though transit options could be improved.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs while maintaining accessibility. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to balance the needs of both transit users and drivers, while also considering the potential for reduced congestion and emissions."
