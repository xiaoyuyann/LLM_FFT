    "disposable_income": "Sunnyside has a relatively low average disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Sunnyside have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Sunnyside has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income in Sunnyside, minimizing costs for both transit and driving is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to ensure affordability. Additionally, reducing travel time is important to improve accessibility and convenience. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, along with reduced travel times, are preferred. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' limited budgets."
