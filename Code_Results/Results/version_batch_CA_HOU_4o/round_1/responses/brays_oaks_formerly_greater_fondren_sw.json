    "disposable_income": "Brays Oaks has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income spent on essentials like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "Brays Oaks has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, the selected proposals aim to provide affordable and efficient transportation options while considering the community's financial constraints."
