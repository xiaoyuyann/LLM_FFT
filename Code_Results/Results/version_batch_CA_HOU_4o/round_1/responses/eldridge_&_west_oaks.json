    "disposable_income": "Eldridge / West Oaks is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Eldridge / West Oaks have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, dining, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on personal vehicles due to limited public transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency, as many residents rely on cars but would benefit from better transit options. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as the community values efficient transportation. The selected policies balance the need for improved transit with the community's ability to absorb additional costs, prioritizing options that significantly reduce travel times for both transit and driving."
