    "disposable_income": "The Mid-West neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in professional sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving transit service quality. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales taxes, which offer significant reductions in travel times, are prioritized."
