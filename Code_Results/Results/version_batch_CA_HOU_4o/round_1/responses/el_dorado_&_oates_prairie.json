    "disposable_income": "El Dorado / Oates Prairie has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit options, making car travel a necessity for many residents, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on essential spending. Reducing travel time is also crucial, as many residents rely on driving. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate tax rates that improve transit times, are prioritized. The top choice balances a low fare and moderate driving fee with a lower tax rate, improving transit times without significantly increasing costs."
