    "disposable_income": "Kingwood is a relatively affluent neighborhood with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kingwood have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and other non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Kingwood has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Kingwood's higher disposable income, residents can absorb moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees. However, the community's reliance on personal vehicles means that policies with high driving fees may be less favorable. A balance between improving transit times and maintaining reasonable costs is essential. Lower sales taxes are preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals that offer reduced travel times for both transit and driving, with moderate fare and fee increases, are prioritized."
