    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep both transit fares and driving fees affordable to avoid burdening residents financially. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times to improve accessibility and efficiency. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate sales tax, and reduced travel times are prioritized."
