    "disposable_income": "Lake Houston is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake Houston have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing car travel time and improving transit efficiency to encourage a shift from driving to public transit, which can alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. A balanced approach with moderate sales tax and fees is preferred to maintain discretionary spending while enhancing transit services."
