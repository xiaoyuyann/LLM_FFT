    "disposable_income": "Minnetex is a lower-income neighborhood, with many residents having limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Minnetex prioritize essential spending, with limited room for discretionary consumption.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit options are limited, and many residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, policies with lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. However, improving transit accessibility is crucial for those without cars. Balancing these needs, proposals with moderate taxes and fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. The top choice is a policy with a low fare and moderate driver fee, which reduces travel time significantly, followed by options that balance fare, tax, and fee to improve transit times without overly burdening residents financially."
