    "disposable_income": "Clinton Park / Tri-Community has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the limited reach and frequency of transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. The community would benefit from improved transit times, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, options with a lower fare and moderate driving fee are preferred, as they offer a balance between cost savings and improved transit service. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly strain the community's limited discretionary spending."
