    "disposable_income": "Alief is a diverse neighborhood with a moderate to low average disposable income, where many residents are budget-conscious.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Alief prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary income for non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Alief has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the area and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income in Alief, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve disposable income for essential goods. However, improving transit times is important to enhance accessibility and reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Therefore, the top-ranked policies balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the trade-offs between fare, tax, and driving fees."
