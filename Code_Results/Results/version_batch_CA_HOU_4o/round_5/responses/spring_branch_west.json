    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch West has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch West has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can reduce travel times and improve accessibility. The community benefits from reduced congestion and emissions, so policies that encourage a shift from driving to transit are favorable. Balancing these factors, the top choices prioritize lower fares and moderate fees, with a focus on reducing travel times and improving service."
