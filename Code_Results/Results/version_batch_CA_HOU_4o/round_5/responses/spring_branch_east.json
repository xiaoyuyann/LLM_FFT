    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch East has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch East have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs manageable for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use while not overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can benefit the community by reducing congestion and improving accessibility. The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and service improvement, considering the community's reliance on both transit and driving."
