    "disposable_income": "The Fourth Ward has a mixed-income population with a significant portion of residents having moderate to low disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Fourth Ward tend to have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The Fourth Ward has moderate accessibility to public transit, with some residents relying heavily on it due to limited car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep transit fares affordable while improving service efficiency. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The community would benefit from reduced travel times, especially for transit, to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while keeping the sales tax at a manageable level."
