    "disposable_income": "Afton Oaks / River Oaks is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this neighborhood have significant discretionary spending, often on luxury goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a high rate of car ownership and less reliance on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary spending, the community can absorb higher costs if it results in better services. However, the preference is to maintain or improve accessibility and reduce travel times. The community is likely to favor policies that improve transit times significantly, even if it means higher fares or fees, as long as the overall impact on their lifestyle is minimal. Therefore, policies with higher driver fees and fares that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized, as they align with the community's ability to pay and desire for efficiency."
