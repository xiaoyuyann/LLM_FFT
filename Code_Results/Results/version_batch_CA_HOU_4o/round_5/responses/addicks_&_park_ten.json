    "disposable_income": "The Addicks / Park Ten neighborhood generally has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in the energy sector and related industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have a higher level of discretionary consumption, with spending on leisure, dining, and retail being common.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options, though transit times are currently longer.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit times. The neighborhood's reliance on both driving and transit means that reducing congestion and improving transit efficiency are priorities. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals that balance lower fares and fees with improved transit times and moderate sales tax rates are prioritized."
