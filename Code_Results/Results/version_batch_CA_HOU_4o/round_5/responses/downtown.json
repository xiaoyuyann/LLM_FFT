    "disposable_income": "Downtown residents generally have a moderate to high disposable income due to a mix of professionals and businesses in the area.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a high level of discretionary consumption with numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options available.",
    "accessibility": "Downtown has excellent accessibility to resources and services, with robust public transit options and walkability, but also experiences significant traffic congestion.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Downtown residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency, as many residents rely on public transportation. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and driver fees, combined with lower sales taxes, are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements."
