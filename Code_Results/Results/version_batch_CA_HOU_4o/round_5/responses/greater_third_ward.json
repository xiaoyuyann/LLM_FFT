    "disposable_income": "The Greater Third Ward has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a significant portion of the population relying on public transit due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep transit fares affordable while improving service efficiency. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The community would benefit from reduced travel times, especially for transit, to improve access to jobs and services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while balancing the need for improved transit services through reasonable sales tax rates."
