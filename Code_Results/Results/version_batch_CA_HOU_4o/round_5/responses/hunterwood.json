    "disposable_income": "Hunterwood has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Hunterwood tend to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Hunterwood has limited public transit options, making car travel a necessity for many residents, though some rely on transit for cost savings.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is crucial to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower fare and driving fee are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this could benefit those who rely on public transportation. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while not excessively increasing the sales tax."
