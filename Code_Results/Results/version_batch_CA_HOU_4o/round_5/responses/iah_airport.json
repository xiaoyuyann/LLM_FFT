    "disposable_income": "The IAH Airport super neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents employed in airport-related services and industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is moderate, with spending focused on essential services and some leisure activities, influenced by the proximity to the airport.",
    "accessibility": "Accessibility is primarily car-dependent due to the airport's location, but there is a need for improved transit options to support airport workers and travelers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance costs with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this can benefit both workers and travelers. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while ensuring that the financial burden on residents remains manageable."
