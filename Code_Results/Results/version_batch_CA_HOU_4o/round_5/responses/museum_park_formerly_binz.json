    "disposable_income": "Museum Park is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income, allowing for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from transportation policies.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Museum Park have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on cultural, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Museum Park has good accessibility to public transit and is close to major cultural and employment centers, making transit improvements particularly beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, Museum Park can accommodate a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significant improvements in transit service and reduced travel times. The community values efficient transit access to cultural and employment centers, so proposals that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. A balance between fare, tax, and driving fees is sought to ensure that both transit users and drivers contribute to improved services without overly burdening any single group."
