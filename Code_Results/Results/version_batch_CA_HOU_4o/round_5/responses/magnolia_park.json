    "disposable_income": "Magnolia Park has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs for both transit and driving is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to ensure affordability. Additionally, reducing travel time is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and reduced travel times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' limited discretionary spending."
