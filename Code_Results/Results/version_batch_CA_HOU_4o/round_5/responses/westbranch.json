    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbranch have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Westbranch has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving to avoid burdening residents financially. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to maintain affordability. The sales tax should be moderate to ensure sufficient funding for transit improvements without significantly impacting discretionary spending. Reducing travel times for both modes is also a priority to improve accessibility and convenience. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate sales tax, and reduced travel times are prioritized."
