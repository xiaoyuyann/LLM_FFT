    "disposable_income": "The Central Northwest neighborhood has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Central Northwest tend to have moderate discretionary spending, balancing essential expenses with some leisure and non-essential purchases.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent access to public transit, but many residents still rely on personal vehicles for commuting due to longer transit times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. Reducing transit fares and driving fees can help alleviate financial burdens. Improving transit times is also crucial to encourage more residents to use public transportation, which can reduce congestion and emissions. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and improved transit times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, but a high tax could strain residents' budgets."
