    "disposable_income": "The Fairbanks / Northwest Crossing neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in middle-income jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have moderate discretionary spending, often prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the spread-out nature of services and employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while not overly burdening residents with high taxes or fees."
