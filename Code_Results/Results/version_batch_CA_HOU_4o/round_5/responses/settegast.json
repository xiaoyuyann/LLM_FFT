    "disposable_income": "Settegast is a lower-income neighborhood, with many residents having limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Settegast have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Settegast has limited access to public transit, and many residents rely on personal vehicles for transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, the community would benefit from policies that minimize costs while improving transit times. Lower fares and driving fees are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could enhance accessibility and reduce travel times. The top-ranked policies balance these factors by offering reduced transit fares and driving fees, with moderate sales tax rates to support transit improvements."
