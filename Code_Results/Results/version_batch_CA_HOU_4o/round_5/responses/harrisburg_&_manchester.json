    "disposable_income": "Harrisburg / Manchester has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income spent on essentials like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with public transit being a crucial mode of transportation for many residents due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, minimizing costs while improving transit times is crucial. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reduce congestion, and improve accessibility. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid burdening residents' limited discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also improve transit times, are prioritized. The balance between cost savings and improved transit service is key, with a focus on reducing travel time and maintaining affordability."
