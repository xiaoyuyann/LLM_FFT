    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Uptown have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, dining, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The focus is on improving transit efficiency and reducing congestion, which aligns with the community's preference for convenience and time savings. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate taxes, reasonable fares, and driver fees that lead to reduced travel times are prioritized."
