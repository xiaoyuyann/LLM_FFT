    "disposable_income": "The South Belt / Ellington neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in middle-income jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving to avoid burdening residents financially. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to maintain affordability. Additionally, a moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can enhance accessibility and reduce travel times. The focus is on balancing cost with improved transit efficiency and reduced travel times, which can benefit both transit users and drivers by reducing congestion."
