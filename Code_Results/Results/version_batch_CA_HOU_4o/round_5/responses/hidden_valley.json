    "disposable_income": "Hidden Valley has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",

    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for many residents, but current services are limited, making accessibility to jobs and services challenging.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial strain. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve disposable income for essential goods. Improved transit times are crucial for better accessibility, so policies that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. Balancing these factors, the top choices aim to enhance transit service while keeping costs manageable for residents."
