    "disposable_income": "Independence Heights has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income spent on essentials like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current transit times are long, and accessibility to resources and services is limited without a car.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, minimizing costs while improving transit times is crucial. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting those who rely on public transportation. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid burdening residents with additional costs. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also improve transit times, are prioritized. The selected proposals balance cost savings with improved transit accessibility, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and limited discretionary income."
