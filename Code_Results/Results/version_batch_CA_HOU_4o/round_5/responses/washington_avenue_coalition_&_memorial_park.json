    "disposable_income": "The Washington Avenue Coalition / Memorial Park area generally has a higher disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have higher discretionary spending, often on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, the community can absorb slightly higher costs if it results in better services. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit services, which can be achieved by slightly increasing fares and driver fees. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and improved transit services, while keeping costs reasonable for both transit users and drivers."
