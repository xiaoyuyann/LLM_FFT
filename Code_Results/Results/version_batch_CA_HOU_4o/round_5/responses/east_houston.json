    "disposable_income": "East Houston has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community prioritizes essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to income constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for many residents, but current services are limited, leading to longer travel times and reliance on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, policies with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize financial strain. Improving transit times is also crucial to enhance accessibility. Therefore, policies with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to balance cost and service improvement. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation."
