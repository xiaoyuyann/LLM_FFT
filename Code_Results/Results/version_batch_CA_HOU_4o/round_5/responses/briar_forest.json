    "disposable_income": "Briar Forest is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Briar Forest have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, leisure, and other non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Briar Forest has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit, though transit options are less frequent and slower compared to driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significantly improved transit services. The neighborhood's reliance on cars means that reducing driving time is also a priority. Therefore, proposals that balance a moderate sales tax with reduced travel times for both transit and driving are preferred. Proposals with a $0.75 transit fare and a $0.5 driving fee are prioritized as they offer a good balance of cost and improved service, while a 1% sales tax is acceptable given the potential for better transit services. The top-ranked proposals are those that offer the best improvements in travel time for both modes at a reasonable cost."
