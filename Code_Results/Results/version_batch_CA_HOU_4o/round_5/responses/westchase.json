    "disposable_income": "Westchase has a moderate to high disposable income due to a mix of residential and commercial areas, with many professionals and businesses located in the area.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westchase have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, with access to various shopping, dining, and entertainment options.",
    "accessibility": "Westchase has good accessibility to resources and services, with a well-connected road network and public transit options, though transit times are longer compared to driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Westchase residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can reduce congestion and emissions. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and driver fees, combined with lower sales taxes, are prioritized."
