    "disposable_income": "Kingwood is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kingwood have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and other non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Kingwood has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Kingwood's higher disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee could encourage some residents to switch to transit, reducing congestion. However, a high sales tax would be less favorable due to its impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower sales tax and moderate driver fees are prioritized, balancing improved transit service with minimal impact on disposable income."
