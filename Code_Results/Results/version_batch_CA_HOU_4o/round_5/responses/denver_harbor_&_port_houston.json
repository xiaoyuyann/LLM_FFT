    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor / Port Houston has a relatively low disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the limited reach and frequency of transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit can reduce reliance on driving, saving costs and time. The top-ranked proposals balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both driving and transit."
