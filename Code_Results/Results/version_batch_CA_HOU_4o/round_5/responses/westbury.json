    "disposable_income": "Westbury has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbury have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Westbury has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the suburban layout and the need for efficient travel to work and amenities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Westbury's moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents, while moderate sales tax rates are acceptable if they significantly improve transit efficiency. Reducing travel times is also a priority to enhance accessibility and convenience for both transit users and drivers. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate sales tax, and reduced travel times are prioritized."
