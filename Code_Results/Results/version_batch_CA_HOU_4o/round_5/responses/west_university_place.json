    "disposable_income": "West University Place is a relatively affluent neighborhood with a high average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in West University Place have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, services, and travel.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a high rate of car ownership and relatively less reliance on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary consumption, residents can afford higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood's preference is likely to lean towards policies that improve transit efficiency and reduce congestion, even if it means a higher sales tax, as the impact on their overall consumption is minimal. Therefore, policies with higher driver fees and moderate to high transit fares are preferred, as they encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and improving travel times for both modes."
