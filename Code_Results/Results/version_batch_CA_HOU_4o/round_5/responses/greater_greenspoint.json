    "disposable_income": "Greater Greenspoint has a relatively lower disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods, with many residents working in service and retail sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Greenspoint have limited discretionary consumption, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a significant portion of the population relying on public transit due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and reliance on public transit, the community would benefit from lower transit fares and minimal increases in sales tax. Reducing travel time is also important to improve access to employment opportunities. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit services and reduce congestion, are prioritized. A balance between maintaining affordability and enhancing transit efficiency is crucial."
