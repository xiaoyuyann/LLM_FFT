    "disposable_income": "Neartown / Montrose is known for its relatively high disposable income due to a mix of affluent residents and young professionals.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a vibrant cultural scene with numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options, indicating high discretionary consumption.",
    "accessibility": "Neartown / Montrose has good accessibility with multiple transit options and is pedestrian-friendly, but traffic congestion can be an issue.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher fares and fees if it results in better transit services and reduced congestion. The focus is on improving transit times and reducing car travel times to enhance overall accessibility. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate fares, reasonable driver fees, and improved travel times are prioritized."
