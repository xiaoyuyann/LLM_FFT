    "disposable_income": "South Park has a relatively low disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in South Park have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "South Park has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are prioritized to reduce costs for both transit users and drivers. Additionally, maintaining or slightly increasing the sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could enhance accessibility and reduce travel times. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, considering the neighborhood's reliance on both transit and personal vehicles."
