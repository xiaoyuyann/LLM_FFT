    "disposable_income": "Eldridge / West Oaks is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Eldridge / West Oaks have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, dining, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on personal vehicles due to limited public transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing congestion and improving transit efficiency to encourage a shift from driving to public transit. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit infrastructure, as the community values efficient transportation. The selected policies balance the need for improved transit services with the community's ability to absorb additional costs, prioritizing options that offer the greatest reduction in travel time and congestion."
