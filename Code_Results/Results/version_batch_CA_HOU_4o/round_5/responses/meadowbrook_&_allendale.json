    "disposable_income": "The Meadowbrook / Allendale neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. However, improving transit times is also important to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, along with reduced travel times, are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents' budgets."
