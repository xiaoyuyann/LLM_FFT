    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Braeburn have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Braeburn has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the area.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could benefit those who rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax rates that offer reduced travel times, are prioritized."
