    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is crucial to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Additionally, a moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, reducing travel times and encouraging a shift from driving to transit to alleviate congestion and emissions."
