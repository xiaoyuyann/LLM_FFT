    "disposable_income": "Midtown residents generally have a moderate to high disposable income, with a mix of young professionals and established residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has a vibrant lifestyle with a high level of discretionary consumption on dining, entertainment, and cultural activities.",
    "accessibility": "Midtown has good accessibility to resources and services, with a well-connected public transit system and walkable areas, but also experiences traffic congestion.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Midtown's moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better transit services and reduced congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency, which aligns with the neighborhood's lifestyle and accessibility needs. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
