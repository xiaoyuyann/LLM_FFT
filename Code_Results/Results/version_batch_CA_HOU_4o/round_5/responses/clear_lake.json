    "disposable_income": "Clear Lake is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Clear Lake have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Clear Lake has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options, though transit times are generally longer.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing travel times for both driving and transit, as well as maintaining a balance between cost and service improvement. Proposals with a moderate sales tax (1%) and a mix of fare and driving fees that lead to reduced travel times are prioritized. The goal is to enhance transit service quality while ensuring that the cost does not overly burden residents' discretionary spending."
