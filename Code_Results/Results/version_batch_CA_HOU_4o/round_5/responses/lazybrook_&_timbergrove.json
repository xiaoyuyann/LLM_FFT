    "disposable_income": "Lazybrook / Timbergrove is a middle to upper-middle-class neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lazybrook / Timbergrove have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, leisure, and home improvement.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making driving a common choice.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the relatively high disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The neighborhood's good accessibility by car means that reducing driving time is also a priority. Therefore, proposals that balance lower sales tax with moderate fare and fee increases, while significantly reducing travel times, are prioritized."
