    "disposable_income": "Memorial is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Memorial have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, dining, and travel.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility by car, but public transit options are less convenient, leading to a higher reliance on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it leads to significant improvements in transit service and reduced congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, which offer significant reductions in travel time, are prioritized."
