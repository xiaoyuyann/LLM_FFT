    "disposable_income": "East Little York / Homestead has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current services are limited and often require long travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, minimizing costs while improving transit services is essential. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use and reduce congestion, benefiting those who rely on public transportation. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The tradeoff involves balancing the immediate financial burden with long-term accessibility improvements."
