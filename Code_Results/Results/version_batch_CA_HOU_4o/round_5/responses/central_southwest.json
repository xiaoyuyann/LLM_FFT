    "disposable_income": "Central Southwest has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury spending.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a significant portion of the population dependent on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, affordability of transit fares is crucial. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A balanced sales tax is necessary to support transit improvements without overly burdening residents. The selected policies prioritize reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while ensuring the community can still afford essential goods and services."
