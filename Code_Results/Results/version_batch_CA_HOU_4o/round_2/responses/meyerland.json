    "disposable_income": "Meyerland is a middle to upper-middle-class neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Meyerland have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on quality education, dining, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Meyerland has decent accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of car and transit options, though car travel is more prevalent due to convenience and speed.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, Meyerland residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving overall transit service quality. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, which offer significant reductions in travel time, are prioritized."
