    "disposable_income": "Minnetex is a lower-income neighborhood, with many residents having limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Minnetex have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Minnetex has limited public transit options, making car travel a necessity for many residents, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and discretionary spending in Minnetex, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are prioritized to minimize financial burden. Additionally, policies that improve transit times are favored to enhance accessibility for those reliant on public transportation. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' limited budgets."
