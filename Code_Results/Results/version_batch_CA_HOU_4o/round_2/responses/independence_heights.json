    "disposable_income": "Independence Heights has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs and relying on affordable housing options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community prioritizes essential spending on housing, food, and transportation, with limited discretionary spending on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current transit times are long, and accessibility to resources and services is limited without a car.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Improving transit times is also crucial to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. A balance between improving transit services and maintaining affordability is key, so options with a 1% sales tax and reduced transit times are favored."
