    "disposable_income": "Willowbrook has a moderate disposable income level, with residents having some flexibility in their spending but still sensitive to significant increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Willowbrook tend to have moderate discretionary consumption, with spending focused on essential goods and services, and some allocation for leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Willowbrook has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit, though transit times are currently longer than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, it is important to balance cost increases with improvements in service. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening residents financially. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. Therefore, proposals that reduce transit times and driving times while keeping costs manageable are prioritized. Proposals with a 0.5% or 1.0% sales tax, lower transit fares, and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance cost and service improvements."
