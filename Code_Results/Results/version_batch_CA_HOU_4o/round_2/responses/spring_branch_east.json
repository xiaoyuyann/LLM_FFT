    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch East has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has a diverse range of discretionary consumption patterns, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch East has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to ensure affordability while encouraging transit use. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and moderate fees to enhance accessibility and reduce travel times without overly burdening residents financially."
