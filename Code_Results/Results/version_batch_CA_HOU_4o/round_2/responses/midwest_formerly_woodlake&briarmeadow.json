    "disposable_income": "The Mid-West neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in professional sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit and driving options, though driving is often preferred due to convenience.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares or driving fees if it results in better services. However, a high sales tax could impact discretionary spending negatively. The neighborhood values reduced travel times and improved transit services, so proposals that offer significant reductions in travel time and moderate costs are prioritized. Proposals with a balance of lower fares and moderate driver fees, along with a reasonable sales tax, are preferred to ensure both affordability and improved service quality."
