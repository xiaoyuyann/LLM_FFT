    "disposable_income": "Downtown residents generally have a moderate to high disposable income due to a mix of professionals and business owners.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a high level of discretionary consumption with numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options.",
    "accessibility": "Downtown has excellent accessibility with multiple transit options and walkability, but traffic congestion can be an issue for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Downtown residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency, which aligns with the high accessibility needs of the area. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and driver fees, combined with lower sales taxes, are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements."
