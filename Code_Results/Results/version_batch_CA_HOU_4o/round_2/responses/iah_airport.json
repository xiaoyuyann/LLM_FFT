    "disposable_income": "The IAH Airport super neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in airport-related industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is relatively balanced, with residents spending on both essential and non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and transit due to the proximity to the airport.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this benefits both transit users and drivers by reducing congestion. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while ensuring the sales tax is not too high to impact discretionary spending significantly."
