    "disposable_income": "East Little York / Homestead has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, prioritizing essential goods and services due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current services are limited, leading to longer travel times and reduced accessibility to resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, affordability of transit fares is crucial. A lower fare and moderate driver fee can improve transit services without overly burdening residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services, reducing travel times and improving accessibility. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors, offering reduced travel times and costs while considering the community's financial constraints."
