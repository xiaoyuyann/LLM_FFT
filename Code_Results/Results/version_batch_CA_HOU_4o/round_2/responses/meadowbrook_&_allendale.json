    "disposable_income": "The Meadowbrook / Allendale neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting residents' budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as this can reduce travel times and improve accessibility. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and moderate driver fees to enhance transit without overly burdening residents financially."
