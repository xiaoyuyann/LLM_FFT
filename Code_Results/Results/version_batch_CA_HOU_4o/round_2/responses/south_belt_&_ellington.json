    "disposable_income": "The South Belt / Ellington neighborhood has a moderate level of disposable income, with many residents working in middle-income jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving to avoid burdening residents financially. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage public transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The balance between cost and improved service is crucial for this community."
