    "disposable_income": "The El Dorado / Oates Prairie neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. Additionally, reducing travel times is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax rates that still improve transit times, are prioritized. The selected proposals aim to enhance transit service without significantly increasing costs for residents."
