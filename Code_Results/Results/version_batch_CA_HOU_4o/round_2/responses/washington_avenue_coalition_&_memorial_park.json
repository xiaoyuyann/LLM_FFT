    "disposable_income": "The Washington Avenue Coalition / Memorial Park area generally has a higher disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have higher discretionary spending, often on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, the community can absorb slightly higher costs if it results in better services. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit services, which can enhance the quality of life. A moderate increase in sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. The community values efficient transit options to reduce congestion and emissions, aligning with environmental goals. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate fare, reasonable driver fees, and improved transit times are prioritized."
