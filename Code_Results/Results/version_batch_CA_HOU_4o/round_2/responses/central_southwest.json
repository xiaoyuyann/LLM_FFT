    "disposable_income": "Central Southwest has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current services are limited, leading to longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels, it's important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. However, improving transit times is also crucial to enhance accessibility. A balance between lower fares and moderate driver fees, along with a reasonable sales tax, will help improve transit services without overly burdening residents financially. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while maintaining affordability."
