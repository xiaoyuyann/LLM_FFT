    "disposable_income": "Willow Meadows / Willowbend is a middle-income neighborhood with moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on essentials and some luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it results in noticeable improvements in transit times. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while maintaining a reasonable sales tax rate."
