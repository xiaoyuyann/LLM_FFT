    "disposable_income": "Trinity / Houston Gardens has a relatively low disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the limited reach and frequency of transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on driving and lower overall transportation costs. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both driving and public transit."
