    "disposable_income": "The Addicks / Park Ten neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in the energy sector and related industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on housing, dining, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it significantly improves transit services. The neighborhood's reliance on both driving and transit means that reducing travel times for both modes is crucial. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use while maintaining reasonable costs for drivers. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs for transit, with moderate increases in sales tax and driver fees to support improved services."
