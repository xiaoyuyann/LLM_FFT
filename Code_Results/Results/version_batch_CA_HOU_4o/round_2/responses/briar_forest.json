    "disposable_income": "Briar Forest is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Briar Forest have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "Briar Forest has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the relatively high disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can reduce congestion and emissions. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales taxes, that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
