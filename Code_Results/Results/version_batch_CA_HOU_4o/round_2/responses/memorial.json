    "disposable_income": "Memorial is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Memorial have significant discretionary spending, often on luxury goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility by car, but public transit options are less convenient and less frequently used.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher fares and fees if it results in better services. However, the community values time savings and convenience, so policies that reduce travel time are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as it aligns with the community's ability to pay and desire for improved infrastructure. The top-ranked policies balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and reasonable costs, both in terms of fares and taxes."
