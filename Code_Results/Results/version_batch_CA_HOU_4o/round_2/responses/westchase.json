    "disposable_income": "Westchase has a moderate to high disposable income level, with many residents employed in professional and managerial positions.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westchase have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "Westchase has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership among residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income and high discretionary consumption, Westchase residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The community values efficient transportation options, so proposals that significantly reduce travel times for both transit and driving are prioritized. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial, as residents are willing to pay more for better services but not at the expense of excessive tax burdens. Therefore, proposals with moderate tax rates and improved travel times are preferred."
