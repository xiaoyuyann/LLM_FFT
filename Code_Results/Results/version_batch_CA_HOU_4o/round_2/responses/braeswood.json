    "disposable_income": "Braeswood is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood with a relatively high level of disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Braeswood have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Braeswood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making driving a common choice.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the relatively high disposable income and discretionary consumption, Braeswood residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood's good accessibility by car means that reducing driving times is also a priority. Therefore, proposals that balance moderate fare and fee increases with significant reductions in travel time are preferred. A lower sales tax is favored to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between cost and improved transit and driving conditions."
