    "disposable_income": "Magnolia Park has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Magnolia Park have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial for residents. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to reduce daily expenses. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and lower overall transportation costs. The top-ranked proposals balance lower costs with improved transit times, which could enhance accessibility and reduce travel time for residents."
