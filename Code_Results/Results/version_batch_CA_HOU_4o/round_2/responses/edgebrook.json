    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. Additionally, reducing travel times is crucial to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax rates that still improve transit times, are prioritized. The selected proposals aim to enhance transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for residents."
