    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Inwood have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driving fees are prioritized to encourage transit use while maintaining affordability. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times for both transit and driving, improving overall accessibility without significantly increasing costs for residents."
