    "disposable_income": "Neartown / Montrose is known for its relatively high disposable income due to a mix of affluent residents and young professionals.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a vibrant cultural and social scene, leading to high discretionary spending on dining, entertainment, and arts.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good access to public transit and is walkable, but traffic congestion can be an issue for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it leads to better services. The community values reduced travel times and improved transit services, which can be achieved by higher driver fees that encourage transit use and reduce congestion. Therefore, proposals with moderate to high driver fees and fares, coupled with a reasonable sales tax, are prioritized. The goal is to balance cost with improved transit efficiency and reduced car travel times."
