    "disposable_income": "Lazybrook / Timbergrove is a middle to upper-middle-class neighborhood with relatively high disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lazybrook / Timbergrove have moderate to high discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, leisure, and home improvement.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of car and transit options, though car travel is more prevalent.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services. However, a high sales tax could impact discretionary spending. The neighborhood values reduced travel times and improved transit services, so proposals that significantly reduce travel times and improve transit are prioritized. Proposals with moderate fare and fee increases, coupled with moderate sales tax, are preferred to balance cost and service improvements."
