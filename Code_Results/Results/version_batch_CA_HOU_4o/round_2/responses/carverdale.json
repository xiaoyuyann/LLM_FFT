    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Carverdale have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Carverdale has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit coverage and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Carverdale's moderate disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, the community would benefit from policies that reduce travel costs and improve transit efficiency. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage a shift to public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, policies with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a lower sales tax, are prioritized to balance cost savings and improved transit services."
