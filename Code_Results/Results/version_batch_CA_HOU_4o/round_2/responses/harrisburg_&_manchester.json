    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting residents' budgets.

The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and service improvement, prioritizing affordability and efficiency for residents."
