    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for East Houston residents, as many rely on it for commuting to work and accessing essential services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel time is also a priority to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, the selected policies aim to provide affordable and efficient transportation options while considering the financial constraints of the community."
