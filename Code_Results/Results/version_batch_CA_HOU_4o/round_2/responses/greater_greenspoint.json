    "disposable_income": "Greater Greenspoint has a relatively lower disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods, with many residents working in service and retail sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Greenspoint have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial for residents. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to reduce daily expenses. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this can enhance accessibility and reduce reliance on driving. The selected policies aim to balance cost savings with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both driving and public transit."
