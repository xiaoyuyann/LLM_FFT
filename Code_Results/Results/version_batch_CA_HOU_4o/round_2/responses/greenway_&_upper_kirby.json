    "disposable_income": "Greenway / Upper Kirby is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greenway / Upper Kirby tend to have higher discretionary spending on luxury goods, dining, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The community values efficient transportation and is willing to support policies that improve transit services, even if it means a moderate increase in sales tax. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency, which aligns with the community's preference for convenience and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with moderate to high driver fees and fares, coupled with improved transit times, are prioritized."
