    "disposable_income": "Sharpstown has a moderate to low disposable income level, with many residents working in service and retail sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Sharpstown has moderate accessibility to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on driving and lower overall transportation costs. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while not excessively increasing the sales tax."
