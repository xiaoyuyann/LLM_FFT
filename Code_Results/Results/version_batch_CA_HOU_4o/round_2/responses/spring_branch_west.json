    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch West has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch West have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit, though transit times are currently longer than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening residents financially. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel times is crucial for both modes of transport. Therefore, proposals that offer reduced travel times and costs for transit, while maintaining reasonable costs for drivers, are prioritized. Proposals with a 1% sales tax are preferred as they balance funding for transit improvements without excessive burden on consumption. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are favored to encourage transit use and reduce congestion."
