    "disposable_income": "The Astrodome Area has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income households and some lower-income residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Astrodome Area have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The Astrodome Area has decent accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs manageable for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use while not overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs while maintaining accessibility. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements."
