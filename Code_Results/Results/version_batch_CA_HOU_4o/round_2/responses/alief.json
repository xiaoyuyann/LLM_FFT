    "disposable_income": "Alief is a diverse community with a moderate to low average disposable income, where many residents are working-class families.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Alief tend to prioritize essential spending on housing, food, and education, with limited discretionary spending on luxury goods.",
    "accessibility": "Alief has moderate accessibility to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the area and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income in Alief, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve disposable income for essential goods. However, improving transit times is crucial to enhance accessibility and reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Therefore, the selected policies balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both transit and driving."
