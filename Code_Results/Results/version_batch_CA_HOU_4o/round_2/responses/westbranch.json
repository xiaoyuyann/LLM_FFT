    "disposable_income": "Westbranch has a moderate level of disposable income, with many residents working in middle-income jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbranch tend to have moderate discretionary spending, balancing between essential needs and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Westbranch has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting, though there is a growing interest in improving transit accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage more people to use public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and improved transit services, considering the community's reliance on cars and the potential benefits of enhanced public transit."
