    "disposable_income": "The Fairbanks / Northwest Crossing neighborhood has a moderate level of disposable income, with many residents working in middle-income jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving to avoid burdening residents financially. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage public transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and service improvement, prioritizing affordability and accessibility."
