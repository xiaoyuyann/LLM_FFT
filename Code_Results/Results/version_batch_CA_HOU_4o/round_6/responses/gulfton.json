    "disposable_income": "Gulfton is a lower-income neighborhood with many residents working in low-wage jobs, meaning disposable income is limited.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Gulfton have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Gulfton has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on it due to lower car ownership rates compared to other neighborhoods.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on public transit, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to minimize financial burden while improving transit services. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid further reducing disposable income. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced transit fares and moderate driver fees, which can improve transit times and accessibility without significantly increasing costs for residents."
