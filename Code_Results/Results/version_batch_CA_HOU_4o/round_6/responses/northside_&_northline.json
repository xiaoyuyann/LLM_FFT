    "disposable_income": "The Northside / Northline neighborhood generally has a lower disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing more on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but improvements could significantly benefit residents who rely on it for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it's crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driver fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel time is also a priority to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, the chosen policies aim to enhance transit services while keeping costs manageable for residents."
