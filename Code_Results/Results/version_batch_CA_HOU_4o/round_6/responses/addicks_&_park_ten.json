    "disposable_income": "The Addicks / Park Ten neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in the energy sector and related industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it significantly improves transit services. However, keeping transit fares low is crucial to encourage public transport use. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it reduces congestion and improves transit times. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales tax rates are prioritized. The top choices reflect a preference for improved transit times and reduced congestion, while maintaining affordability for transit users."
