    "disposable_income": "Briar Forest is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Briar Forest have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Briar Forest has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the relatively high disposable income, Briar Forest residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood's reliance on both cars and transit means that policies reducing travel time for both modes are beneficial. A balance between tax rates, fares, and fees is crucial to ensure that the cost does not outweigh the benefits of improved services. Therefore, proposals with moderate taxes and fees that offer significant reductions in travel time are prioritized."
