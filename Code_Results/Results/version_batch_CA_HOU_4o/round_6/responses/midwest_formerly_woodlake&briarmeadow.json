    "disposable_income": "The Mid-West neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in professional sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it significantly improves transit services. However, maintaining a balance between transit fare and driving fees is crucial to not overly burden either transit users or drivers. The neighborhood's good accessibility means that reducing travel times is a priority, especially for transit users. Therefore, proposals that offer reduced travel times for both transit and driving, while keeping costs reasonable, are preferred. Proposals with a moderate sales tax and balanced fare and driving fees are prioritized to ensure improved transit services without excessive financial burden."
