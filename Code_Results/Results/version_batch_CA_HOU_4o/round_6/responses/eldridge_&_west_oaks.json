    "disposable_income": "Eldridge / West Oaks is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Eldridge / West Oaks have a significant level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, the community can absorb moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax, that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
