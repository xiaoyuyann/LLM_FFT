    "disposable_income": "MacGregor has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in MacGregor have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "MacGregor has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and costs could significantly benefit the community, especially for those without personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while ensuring that the financial burden on residents is manageable. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to enhance accessibility and affordability."
