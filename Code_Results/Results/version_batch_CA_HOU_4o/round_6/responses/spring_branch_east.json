    "accessibility": "Spring Branch East has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driving fees are preferred to ensure affordability for residents who rely on public transit. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can enhance accessibility and reduce congestion. The selected policies prioritize lower transit fares and moderate driving fees to maintain affordability while improving transit efficiency and reducing car travel times."
