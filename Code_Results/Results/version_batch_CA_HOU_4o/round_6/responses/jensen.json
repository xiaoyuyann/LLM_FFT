    "disposable_income": "The Jensen super neighborhood has a relatively low disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jensen have limited discretionary consumption, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Jensen has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred. Additionally, improving transit times is important to enhance accessibility. Balancing these factors, proposals with a 0.5% sales tax, lower fares, and moderate driving fees are prioritized to ensure affordability while improving transit services. The selected proposals aim to reduce travel times and costs without significantly increasing the financial burden on residents."
