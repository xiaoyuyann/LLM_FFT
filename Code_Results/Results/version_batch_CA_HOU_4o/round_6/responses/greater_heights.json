    "disposable_income": "Greater Heights is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Heights have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and other lifestyle activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making both driving and transit viable options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, while keeping costs reasonable. Proposals with a balance of lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax, that also offer significant reductions in travel time, are prioritized."
