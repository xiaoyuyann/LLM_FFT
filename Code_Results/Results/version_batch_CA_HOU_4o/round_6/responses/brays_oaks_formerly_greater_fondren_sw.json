    "disposable_income": "Brays Oaks has a moderate to low disposable income level, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary income for non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Brays Oaks has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the area and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and lower overall transportation costs. The top-ranked proposals balance lower costs with improved transit times, which could enhance accessibility and reduce travel time for residents who rely on public transportation."
