    "disposable_income": "Acres Home has a relatively low median household income compared to other Houston neighborhoods, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Acres Home have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Acres Home has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve discretionary spending. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is important to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reduced travel times are prioritized."
