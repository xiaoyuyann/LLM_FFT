    "disposable_income": "Hunterwood has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Hunterwood tend to prioritize essential goods and services, with limited discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Hunterwood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Additionally, reducing travel time is crucial to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and reduced travel times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents' consumption of essential goods."
