    "disposable_income": "Neartown / Montrose is known for its relatively high disposable income due to a mix of professionals and affluent residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a vibrant cultural and dining scene, indicating a high level of discretionary consumption.",
    "accessibility": "Neartown / Montrose has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and walkability, but still relies on cars for some commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher fares and fees if it results in better transit services and reduced congestion. The community values accessibility and efficient transit, so proposals that significantly reduce travel time are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it enhances transit services, but the community prefers to avoid the highest tax rate to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate taxes, reasonable fares, and driver fees that improve transit times are ranked higher."
