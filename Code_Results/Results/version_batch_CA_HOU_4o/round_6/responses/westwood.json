    "disposable_income": "Westwood has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westwood have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Westwood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit coverage and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income in Westwood, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve discretionary spending. Improved transit times are important, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals that balance reduced travel times with minimal cost increases are prioritized. The top choices reflect a preference for lower fares and fees, with moderate improvements in travel times, while maintaining a reasonable sales tax rate."
