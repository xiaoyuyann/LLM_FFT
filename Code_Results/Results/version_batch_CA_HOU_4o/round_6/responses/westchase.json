    "disposable_income": "Westchase has a moderate to high disposable income due to a mix of residential and commercial areas, with many professionals and businesses located in the area.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westchase have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, with access to various shopping, dining, and entertainment options.",
    "accessibility": "Westchase has good accessibility to resources and services, with major highways and public transit options available, though transit times are longer compared to driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Westchase residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit times. The community values efficient transportation options to support its professional and business activities. Therefore, proposals that reduce travel time significantly, even with higher fares and fees, are prioritized. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is also considered, with a preference for moderate tax increases that lead to noticeable transit improvements."
