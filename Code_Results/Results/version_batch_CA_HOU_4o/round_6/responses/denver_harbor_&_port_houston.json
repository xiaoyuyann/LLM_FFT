    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor / Port Houston has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to reduce daily expenses. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel time is also important to improve access to employment and services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate sales tax, and reduced travel times are preferred."
