    "disposable_income": "Willowbrook has a moderate disposable income level, with residents having some flexibility in their spending but still being sensitive to significant increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Willowbrook tend to have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and are cautious about additional expenses that could impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Willowbrook has decent accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and public transit, though transit times are currently longer than driving times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost savings with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while ensuring that any additional taxes or fees are justified by tangible improvements in service."
