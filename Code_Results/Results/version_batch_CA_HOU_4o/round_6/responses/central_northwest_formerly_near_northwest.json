    "disposable_income": "The Central Northwest neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Central Northwest have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and limited luxury spending.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the spread-out nature of services and employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to balance costs with improved services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit users and drivers, while ensuring the community can afford the changes. Proposals with lower fares and moderate fees are prioritized to enhance accessibility and reduce congestion."
