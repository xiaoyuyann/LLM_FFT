    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred. Additionally, improving transit times is important to enhance accessibility. A balance between a reasonable sales tax and improved transit services is necessary to ensure affordability and accessibility. Proposals with a 0.5% sales tax and lower fares and fees are prioritized to minimize financial impact while slightly improving transit times."
