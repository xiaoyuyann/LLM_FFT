    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this neighborhood have significant discretionary spending, often on luxury goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a preference for driving due to convenience and status.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The preference is for policies that improve transit times significantly, even if it means higher costs, as the community values efficiency and convenience. A moderate sales tax is acceptable to support transit improvements, but the focus is on reducing travel times for both driving and transit. Therefore, policies with higher driver fees and fares that lead to the most significant reduction in travel times are prioritized."
