    "disposable_income": "Westbranch has a moderate level of disposable income, with residents generally able to afford basic necessities but being cautious about additional expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbranch tend to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Westbranch has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and public transit, though transit times are currently longer.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to minimize additional costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it results in better transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while ensuring that any increase in taxes or fees is justified by tangible improvements in service."
