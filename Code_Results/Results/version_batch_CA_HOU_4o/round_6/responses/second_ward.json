    "disposable_income": "The Second Ward has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The Second Ward has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it is crucial to minimize costs for residents while improving transit efficiency. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage public transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both transit and driving."
