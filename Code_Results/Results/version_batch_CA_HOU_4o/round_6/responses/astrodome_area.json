    "disposable_income": "The Astrodome Area has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income households and some lower-income residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Astrodome Area have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The Astrodome Area has decent accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents, while moderate sales tax rates are acceptable if they significantly improve transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as maintaining affordability for residents. Proposals with lower fares and moderate fees that offer significant reductions in travel time are prioritized."
