    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. Additionally, reducing travel times is crucial to improve accessibility and quality of life.
