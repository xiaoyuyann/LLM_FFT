    "disposable_income": "Kashmere Gardens has a relatively low average disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kashmere Gardens have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited access to resources and services, with many residents relying on public transit due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income and reliance on public transit, policies with lower transit fares and moderate sales taxes are prioritized to minimize financial burden while improving transit services. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel time and improves transit efficiency, as this could benefit residents who rely on public transportation. The focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit accessibility and efficiency."
