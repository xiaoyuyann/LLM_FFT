    "disposable_income": "Westbury has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbury have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some capacity for leisure and non-essential spending.",
    "accessibility": "Westbury has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban layout and the need to commute to other parts of Houston for work and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Westbury's moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of improved transit services. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents, while a moderate sales tax can support transit improvements. Reducing travel times is also a priority to enhance accessibility and convenience. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, moderate sales tax, and reduced travel times are prioritized."
