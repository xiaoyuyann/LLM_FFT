    "disposable_income": "The South Main neighborhood has a moderate level of disposable income, with residents having some flexibility in their spending but still being sensitive to significant increases in costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in South Main tend to allocate a fair portion of their income to discretionary spending, including dining, entertainment, and retail, indicating a preference for maintaining a balance between necessary expenses and lifestyle choices.",
    "accessibility": "South Main has decent accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit and driving options, though improvements in transit times could enhance overall accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, the community would benefit from policies that balance cost with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which also reduce travel times, are prioritized. The decision aims to enhance transit accessibility while considering the financial impact on residents."
