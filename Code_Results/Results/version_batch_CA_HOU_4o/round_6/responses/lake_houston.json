    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake Houston have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services. However, the reliance on personal vehicles means that policies with high driving fees may be less favorable. A balance between improving transit times and maintaining reasonable costs is crucial. Lower sales tax rates are preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, policies that offer reduced travel times for both transit and driving, with moderate fare and fee increases, are prioritized."
