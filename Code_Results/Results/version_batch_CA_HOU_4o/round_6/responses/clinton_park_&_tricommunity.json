    "disposable_income": "Clinton Park / Tri-Community has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income spent on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the limited reach and frequency of transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's limited disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens while improving transit accessibility. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized, balancing cost and service improvement."
