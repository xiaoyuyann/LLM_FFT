    "disposable_income": "The IAH Airport area has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in airport-related jobs and service industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the IAH Airport area have limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels, focusing spending on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to the airport and surrounding commercial areas, but public transit options are limited, making driving a primary mode of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels, minimizing costs is crucial. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on driving and improve accessibility. The top-ranked proposals balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both driving and transit."
