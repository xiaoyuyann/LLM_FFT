    "disposable_income": "Greenway / Upper Kirby is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this neighborhood have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and luxury goods.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significantly improved transit services. The neighborhood's high car ownership means that driver fees should be considered carefully to avoid excessive burden. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency, while maintaining a balance in costs. Proposals with moderate sales tax and driver fees, but lower transit fares, are prioritized to encourage transit use without overly penalizing drivers."
