    "disposable_income": "Midtown residents generally have a moderate to high disposable income, with a mix of young professionals and established residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has a vibrant lifestyle with a high level of discretionary consumption on dining, entertainment, and cultural activities.",
    "accessibility": "Midtown has good accessibility to resources and services, with a well-connected public transit system and walkable areas, but also experiences traffic congestion.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving transit service quality to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which aligns with the neighborhood's accessibility and lifestyle needs."
