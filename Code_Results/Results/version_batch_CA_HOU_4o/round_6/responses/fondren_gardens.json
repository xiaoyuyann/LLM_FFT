    "disposable_income": "Fondren Gardens has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Fondren Gardens tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of services and employment opportunities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. Additionally, reducing travel times is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, the top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and fees while considering the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents' budgets."
