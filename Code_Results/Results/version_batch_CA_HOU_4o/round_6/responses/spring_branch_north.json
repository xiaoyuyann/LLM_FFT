    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch North has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with residents spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch North has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit service, as this can reduce travel times and improve accessibility. The selected policies aim to balance cost, travel time, and accessibility improvements, while considering the community's income levels and consumption patterns."
