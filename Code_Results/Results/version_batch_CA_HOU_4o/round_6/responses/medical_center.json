    "disposable_income": "The Medical Center neighborhood has a relatively high disposable income due to the presence of healthcare professionals and researchers.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Medical Center area tend to have higher discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and healthcare services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a well-connected transit system and proximity to major healthcare facilities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significantly improved transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency, as many residents rely on public transportation to commute to work. A higher driver fee is acceptable if it leads to reduced congestion and faster transit times. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate tax, fare, and driver fee that significantly improve transit times are prioritized."
