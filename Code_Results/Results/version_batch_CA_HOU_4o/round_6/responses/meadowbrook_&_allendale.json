    "disposable_income": "The Meadowbrook / Allendale neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and improve accessibility. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while not overly increasing the sales tax burden."
