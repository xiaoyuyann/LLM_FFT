    "disposable_income": "Memorial is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Memorial have significant discretionary spending, often on luxury goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility by car, but public transit options are less developed, leading to longer transit times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher fares and fees if it results in better services. However, the community values time efficiency, so reducing travel time is a priority. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing transit times and improving service quality, even if it means slightly higher costs, as the community can absorb these costs. Therefore, proposals that offer the best balance of reduced travel time and moderate cost increases are prioritized."
