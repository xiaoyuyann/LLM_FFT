    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred. However, improving transit accessibility and reducing travel times is also crucial. A balance between affordable costs and improved services is necessary. Proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. The decision also considers the potential for reduced congestion and emissions, which can improve overall quality of life."
