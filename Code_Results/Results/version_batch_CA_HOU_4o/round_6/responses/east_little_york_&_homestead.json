    "disposable_income": "East Little York / Homestead has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income spent on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, affordability of transit fares and driving fees is crucial. A lower fare and moderate driving fee can encourage transit use while maintaining affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, reducing travel time and enhancing accessibility. The selected policies balance cost with improved transit efficiency, aiming to reduce travel time and congestion, which benefits both transit users and drivers."
