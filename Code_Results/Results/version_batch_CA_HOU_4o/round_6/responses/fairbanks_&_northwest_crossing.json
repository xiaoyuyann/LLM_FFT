    "disposable_income": "Fairbanks / Northwest Crossing has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with residents spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs manageable for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can reduce travel times and improve accessibility. The selected policies aim to balance cost, accessibility, and service improvement, considering the neighborhood's reliance on both transit and driving."
