    "disposable_income": "Downtown residents generally have a moderate to high disposable income due to a mix of professionals and businesses in the area.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a high level of discretionary consumption with numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options available.",
    "accessibility": "Downtown has excellent accessibility to resources and services, with robust public transit options and walkability, but also experiences significant traffic congestion.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Downtown residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in improved transit services and reduced congestion. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency. A moderate sales tax is acceptable to support these improvements. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing transit and driving times while balancing costs, as Downtown residents value time efficiency and are willing to pay slightly more for better services."
