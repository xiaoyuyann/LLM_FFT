    "disposable_income": "The Washington Avenue Coalition / Memorial Park area generally has a higher disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have higher discretionary spending, often on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The focus is on balancing improved transit services with reasonable costs. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Proposals with moderate transit fares and driver fees, along with reduced travel times, are prioritized. The goal is to enhance transit efficiency while keeping costs manageable for both transit users and drivers."
