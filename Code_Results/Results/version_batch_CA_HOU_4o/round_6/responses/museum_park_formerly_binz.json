    "disposable_income": "Museum Park is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Museum Park have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on cultural, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Museum Park has good accessibility to resources and services, with multiple transit options and proximity to major city attractions.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on balancing cost with improved accessibility and reduced congestion. Lower sales tax options are preferred to maintain discretionary spending, while moderate fare and driver fees are acceptable if they lead to better transit services and reduced travel times. The top-ranked proposals reflect a balance between maintaining affordability and enhancing transit efficiency."
