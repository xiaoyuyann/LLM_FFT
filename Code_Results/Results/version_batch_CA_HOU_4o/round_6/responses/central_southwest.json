    "disposable_income": "Central Southwest has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Central Southwest have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and improve accessibility. The top-ranked proposals balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both driving and public transit."
