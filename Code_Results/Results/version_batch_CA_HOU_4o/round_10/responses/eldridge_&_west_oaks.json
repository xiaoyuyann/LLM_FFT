    "disposable_income": "Eldridge / West Oaks is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Eldridge / West Oaks have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a slightly higher sales tax if it results in better transit services. However, maintaining low transit fares is important to encourage public transport use. A moderate driver fee is acceptable if it significantly reduces travel time and congestion. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and improved transit services without excessively increasing costs."
