    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current transit times are long, and accessibility to resources and services is limited.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, reducing travel times and enhancing accessibility. The focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit efficiency to benefit the majority of residents who rely on public transportation."
