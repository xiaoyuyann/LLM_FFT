    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch Central has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch Central have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, it is important to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting household budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as this can improve accessibility and reduce congestion. The selected policies prioritize reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while considering the financial impact on residents."
