    "disposable_income": "Memorial is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Memorial have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility by car, but public transit options are less convenient and less frequently used.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary consumption, residents can afford higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services. However, the preference is to maintain or slightly reduce car travel times and costs, as driving is the primary mode of transportation. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, which could reduce congestion and improve overall accessibility. Therefore, proposals that balance moderate taxes and fees with improved transit times and reduced car travel times are prioritized."
