    "disposable_income": "Fondren Gardens has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Fondren Gardens have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of services and employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and improve accessibility. The top-ranked proposals balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both driving and public transit."
