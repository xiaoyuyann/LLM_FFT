    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Inwood have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times and improved transit services. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driving fees are prioritized to encourage transit use while maintaining affordability. The goal is to improve transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents who rely on both transit and driving."
