    "disposable_income": "Briar Forest is a relatively affluent neighborhood with a higher than average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Briar Forest have a significant level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and other non-essential services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, which offer significant reductions in travel times, are prioritized."
