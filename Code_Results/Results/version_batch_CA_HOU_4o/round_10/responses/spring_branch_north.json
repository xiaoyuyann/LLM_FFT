    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch North has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch North have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this can enhance accessibility and reduce travel times. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while maintaining a reasonable tax rate to support transit improvements."
