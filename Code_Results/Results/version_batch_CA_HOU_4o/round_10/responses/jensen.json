    "disposable_income": "The Jensen super neighborhood has a moderate disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jensen prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Jensen has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a significant portion of the population dependent on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on public transit, the community would benefit from lower transit fares and moderate driver fees to improve transit services without significantly increasing costs. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The selected policies aim to balance improved transit times and costs, encouraging a shift from driving to transit, which could reduce congestion and emissions."
