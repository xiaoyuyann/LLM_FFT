    "disposable_income": "Fairbanks / Northwest Crossing has a moderate disposable income level, with a mix of middle-income households and some lower-income residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening residents financially. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel times is also a priority to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable travel times are prioritized."
