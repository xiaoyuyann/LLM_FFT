    "disposable_income": "Neartown / Montrose is known for its relatively high disposable income due to a mix of professionals and affluent residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a vibrant cultural and dining scene, indicating a high level of discretionary consumption.",
    "accessibility": "Neartown / Montrose has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and walkability, but still relies on cars for some commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher fares and fees if it results in better transit services and reduced travel times. The community values accessibility and reduced congestion, so proposals that significantly improve transit times and reduce car travel times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, but the community would prefer to avoid the highest tax rate to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate taxes, reasonable fares, and driver fees that lead to improved transit and driving times are preferred."
