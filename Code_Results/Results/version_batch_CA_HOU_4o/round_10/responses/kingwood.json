    "disposable_income": "Kingwood is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kingwood have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and other non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Kingwood has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Kingwood's higher disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit times and reduce congestion without significantly increasing costs. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as the community can absorb this cost. Lower transit fares and moderate driving fees are preferred to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The top-ranked policies balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while maintaining a reasonable tax rate to support transit improvements."
