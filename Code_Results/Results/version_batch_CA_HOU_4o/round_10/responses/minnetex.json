    "disposable_income": "Minnetex is a lower-income neighborhood, with many residents having limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Minnetex prioritize essential spending, with limited room for discretionary consumption.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit options are limited, making car travel a necessity for many residents, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, policies with lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. However, improving transit times is also crucial for those reliant on public transportation. Balancing these factors, policies with moderate sales tax and lower fares and fees are prioritized to enhance transit services without significantly impacting residents' budgets. The top choices aim to reduce travel times while keeping costs manageable, considering the community's reliance on both driving and transit."
