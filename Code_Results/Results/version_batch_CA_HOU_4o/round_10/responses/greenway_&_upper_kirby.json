    "disposable_income": "Greenway / Upper Kirby is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this neighborhood have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and luxury goods.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A moderate sales tax is acceptable to support transit improvements. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as maintaining a balance between cost and service quality. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use while still accommodating drivers. The selected proposals aim to improve overall transportation efficiency and service quality, which aligns with the neighborhood's preference for convenience and accessibility."
