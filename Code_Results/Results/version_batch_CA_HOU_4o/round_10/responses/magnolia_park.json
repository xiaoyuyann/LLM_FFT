    "disposable_income": "Magnolia Park has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary income for non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit coverage and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are preferred to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit can reduce reliance on personal vehicles. The top-ranked proposals balance lower costs with improved transit times, considering the community's reliance on both transit and driving."
