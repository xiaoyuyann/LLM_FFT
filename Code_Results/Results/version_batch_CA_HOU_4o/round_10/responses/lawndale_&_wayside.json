    "disposable_income": "Lawndale / Wayside has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to income constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current services are limited and often require long travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred. However, improving transit accessibility and reducing travel times is also crucial. A balance between affordable costs and improved services is necessary. Proposals with lower fares and moderate taxes that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. The community would benefit from policies that encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions, while keeping costs manageable."
