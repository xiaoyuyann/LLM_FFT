    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch East has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch East has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage public transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The community values reduced travel times and costs, so proposals that offer these benefits are prioritized. Balancing the cost of living with improved transit services is key to supporting the community's needs."
