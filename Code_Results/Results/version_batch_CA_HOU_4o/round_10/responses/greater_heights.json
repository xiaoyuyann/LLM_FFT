    "disposable_income": "Greater Heights is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Heights have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and other lifestyle activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making both driving and transit viable options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, while balancing costs. Proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax, that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
