    "disposable_income": "The Greater Third Ward has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is limited, with residents prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a significant portion of the population relying on public transit due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep transit fares affordable while improving service efficiency. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The community would benefit from reduced travel times, especially for transit, to improve access to jobs and services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which encourage a shift from driving to transit, are prioritized. The balance between improving transit times and keeping costs low is key, so options with a 0.5% sales tax and lower fares are favored, as they offer improved transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents."
