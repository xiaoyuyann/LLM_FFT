    "disposable_income": "Westbury has a moderate disposable income level, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbury have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Westbury has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with some reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Westbury's moderate income levels and reliance on both transit and driving, the community would benefit from policies that balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this can enhance accessibility and reduce congestion. The selected policies prioritize reduced travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while considering the community's financial constraints."
