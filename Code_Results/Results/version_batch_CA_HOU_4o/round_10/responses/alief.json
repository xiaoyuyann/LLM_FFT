    "disposable_income": "Alief is a diverse community with a moderate to low average disposable income, where many residents are budget-conscious.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Alief prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Alief has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the spread-out nature of the area and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income in Alief, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve disposable income for essential goods. Improved transit times are beneficial, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, proposals that balance reduced travel times with minimal cost increases are prioritized. The top choices reflect a preference for lower fares and fees, with moderate improvements in travel times, while maintaining a reasonable sales tax rate."
