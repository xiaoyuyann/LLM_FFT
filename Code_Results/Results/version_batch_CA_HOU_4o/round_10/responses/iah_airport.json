    "disposable_income": "The IAH Airport area has a moderate disposable income, with many residents working in airport-related jobs and service industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Discretionary consumption is moderate, with spending focused on essential services and some leisure activities, influenced by the proximity to the airport.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to the airport and surrounding commercial areas, but public transit options are limited, making driving a common choice for residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to balance costs with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as this can reduce reliance on driving and improve accessibility. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and moderate driver fees to enhance transit without overly burdening residents financially."
