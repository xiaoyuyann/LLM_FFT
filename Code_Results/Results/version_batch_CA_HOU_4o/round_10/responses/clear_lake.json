    "disposable_income": "Clear Lake is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Clear Lake have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Clear Lake has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options, though transit times are longer.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significantly improved transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency, as many residents commute to work. A balance between tax, fare, and driving fees is crucial to ensure that the community benefits from reduced congestion and improved transit without overly burdening residents financially. Proposals with moderate sales tax and driving fees, coupled with lower transit fares, are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce car dependency."
