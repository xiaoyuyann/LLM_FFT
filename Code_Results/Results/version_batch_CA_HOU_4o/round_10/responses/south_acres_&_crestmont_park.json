    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a significant portion of the population relying on public transit due to limited car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep transit fares affordable while improving service efficiency. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. The community would benefit from reduced travel times, especially for transit, to improve access to jobs and services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while keeping the sales tax at a manageable level."
