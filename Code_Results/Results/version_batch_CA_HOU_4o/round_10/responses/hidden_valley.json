    "disposable_income": "Hidden Valley has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for many residents, but current services are limited, making accessibility to jobs and services challenging.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. However, improving transit accessibility is also crucial, so a balance between cost and service improvement is necessary. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. The selected policies aim to reduce travel times and costs while improving transit services, considering the community's financial constraints and reliance on public transit."
