    "disposable_income": "South Park has a relatively low average disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in South Park have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "South Park has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit can reduce reliance on personal vehicles and lower overall transportation costs. The selected policies balance affordability with improved transit times, aiming to enhance accessibility without imposing excessive costs on residents."
