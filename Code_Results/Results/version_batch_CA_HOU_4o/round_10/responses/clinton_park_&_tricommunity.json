    "disposable_income": "Clinton Park / Tri-Community has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income spent on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the limited reach and frequency of transit services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit can reduce reliance on personal vehicles. The selected policies aim to balance cost savings with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both transit and driving."
