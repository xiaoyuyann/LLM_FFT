    "disposable_income": "The Addicks / Park Ten neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in the energy sector and related industries.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on housing, dining, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood's reliance on both cars and transit means that policies reducing travel time for both modes are beneficial. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales taxes, which also offer reduced travel times, are prioritized."
