    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake Houston have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it leads to significant improvements in transit services and reduced congestion. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit efficiency, while maintaining a reasonable cost structure. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, coupled with lower sales taxes, are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements."
