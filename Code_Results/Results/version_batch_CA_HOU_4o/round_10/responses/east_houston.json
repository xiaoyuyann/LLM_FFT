    "disposable_income": "East Houston has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs and relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community prioritizes essential spending on housing, food, and utilities, with limited discretionary spending on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current transit times are long, and accessibility to resources and services is limited without a car.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to keep transit fares and driving fees low to minimize the financial burden on residents. However, improving transit times is also crucial to enhance accessibility. A balance between a reasonable sales tax and low fares/fees is necessary to support better transit services without significantly impacting discretionary consumption. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while maintaining affordability."
