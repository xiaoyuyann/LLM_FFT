    "disposable_income": "The Mid-West neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with a mix of middle-class and upper-middle-class residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, retail, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of public transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making both driving and transit viable options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, as well as improving transit services to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can reduce congestion and emissions. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, that offer significant reductions in travel times are prioritized."
