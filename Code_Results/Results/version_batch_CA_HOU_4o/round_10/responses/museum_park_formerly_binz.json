    "disposable_income": "Museum Park is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Museum Park have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on cultural, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Museum Park has good accessibility to resources and services, with multiple transit options and proximity to major cultural and educational institutions.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency, as many residents value time savings and environmental benefits. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, but the impact on discretionary spending should be minimized. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized."
