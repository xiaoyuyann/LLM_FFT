    "disposable_income": "Westwood has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westwood have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Westwood has moderate accessibility to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. Additionally, reducing travel times is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax rates that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs, are prioritized."
