    "disposable_income": "Westbranch has a moderate level of disposable income, with many residents working in middle-income jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbranch tend to have moderate discretionary spending, balancing between essential needs and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Westbranch has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting, but there is a growing interest in improving transit accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage more people to use public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing travel time and cost for both transit and driving, while also considering the impact of sales tax on discretionary spending. Proposals with a $0.75 transit fare and moderate driver fees are preferred to balance affordability and service improvement."
