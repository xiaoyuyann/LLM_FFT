    "disposable_income": "MacGregor has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in MacGregor have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "MacGregor has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and costs could significantly benefit the community, especially for those who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transit fares and driving fees with the benefits of reduced travel times. Lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The top-ranked proposals prioritize lower fares and fees while considering the impact on travel times and overall accessibility improvements."
