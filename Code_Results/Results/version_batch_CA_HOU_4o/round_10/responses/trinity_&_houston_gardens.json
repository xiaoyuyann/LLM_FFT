    "disposable_income": "The Trinity / Houston Gardens neighborhood generally has a lower disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this neighborhood have limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it is crucial to minimize costs for residents while improving transit services. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the financial burden on residents. Therefore, proposals with a $0.75 transit fare, a 0.5% sales tax, and a $0.50 driver fee are prioritized, as they offer reduced travel times and costs without significantly increasing the financial burden on residents."
