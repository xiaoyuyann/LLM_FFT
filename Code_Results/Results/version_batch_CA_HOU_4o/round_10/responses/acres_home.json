    "disposable_income": "Acres Home has a relatively low median household income compared to other Houston neighborhoods, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Acres Home have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Acres Home has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. A lower sales tax is also favored to reduce the impact on discretionary spending. Improved transit times are beneficial, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs. Therefore, policies that balance reduced travel times with affordable costs are prioritized."
