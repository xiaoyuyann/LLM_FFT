    "disposable_income": "Carverdale has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Carverdale tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Carverdale has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the neighborhood and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. Additionally, improving transit times is crucial to make public transportation a more viable option for residents. Balancing these factors, proposals with lower fares and fees, and moderate sales tax rates that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs, are prioritized."
