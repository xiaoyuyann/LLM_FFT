    "disposable_income": "South Main has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in South Main have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "South Main has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to balance costs with benefits. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. Proposal 1 offers the lowest fare and highest driver fee, reducing transit time significantly, which is beneficial. Proposal 8 offers a good balance with moderate fare and driver fee, improving transit time. Proposal 11 has a moderate fare and high driver fee, further reducing transit time. Proposal 19 offers a moderate fare and driver fee with a higher tax, improving transit time. Proposal 23, with the highest tax and fees, offers the best transit time but at a higher cost, which is a tradeoff for significant transit improvements."
