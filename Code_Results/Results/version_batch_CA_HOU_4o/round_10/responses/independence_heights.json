    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for Independence Heights, as many residents depend on it for commuting to work and accessing essential services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is important to keep transit fares low to ensure affordability for residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. A higher driver fee can be justified if it leads to reduced congestion and better transit times, benefiting the majority who use public transit. The selected policies balance affordability, improved transit service, and reduced travel times."
