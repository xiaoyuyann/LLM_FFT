    "disposable_income": "Pecan Park has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Pecan Park have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Pecan Park has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the current transit travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to maintain affordability. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit can reduce reliance on personal vehicles and improve accessibility. The selected policies aim to balance cost savings with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on both transit and personal vehicles."
