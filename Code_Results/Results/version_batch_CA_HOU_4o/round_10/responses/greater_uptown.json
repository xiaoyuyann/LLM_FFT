    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Uptown have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, dining, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, but traffic congestion can be an issue.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it leads to significant improvements in transit times and reduced congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times and improving transit service to encourage a shift from driving to transit, which can alleviate congestion and improve overall accessibility. Therefore, proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, which offer significant reductions in travel time, are prioritized."
