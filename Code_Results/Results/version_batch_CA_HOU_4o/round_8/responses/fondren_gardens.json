    "disposable_income": "Fondren Gardens has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Fondren Gardens tend to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited access to public transit options, making car travel a necessity for many residents, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels, it is important to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could benefit residents who rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is also a priority to improve accessibility and convenience. The selected proposals balance these considerations by offering lower fares and fees while aiming to reduce travel times, thus enhancing overall accessibility without imposing excessive financial strain."
