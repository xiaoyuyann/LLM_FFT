    "disposable_income": "Meyerland is a middle to upper-middle-class neighborhood with a relatively high disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Meyerland have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on quality education, dining, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Meyerland has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership, making driving a common mode of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, Meyerland residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood's reliance on cars suggests that reducing driving time is important, but improving transit times could encourage more residents to use public transportation, reducing congestion. A balanced approach with moderate taxes and fees that improve both transit and driving conditions is preferred. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax and driving fees, along with reduced travel times, are prioritized."
