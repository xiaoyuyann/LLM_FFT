    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch West has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on essentials and some leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch West has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage public transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it improves transit services, as better transit can reduce travel times and congestion. The selected policies aim to balance cost, accessibility, and service improvement, considering the community's reliance on both transit and driving."
