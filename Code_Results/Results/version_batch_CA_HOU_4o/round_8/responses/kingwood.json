    "disposable_income": "Kingwood is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kingwood have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and other non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Kingwood has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Kingwood's higher disposable income and reliance on personal vehicles, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees could encourage some residents to switch to transit, reducing congestion. However, a high sales tax would be less favorable due to its impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, policies with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a moderate sales tax, are prioritized to balance improved transit services with minimal financial impact."
