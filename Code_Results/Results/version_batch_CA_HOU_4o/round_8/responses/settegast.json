    "disposable_income": "Settegast is a lower-income neighborhood, with many residents having limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Settegast have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Settegast has limited access to public transportation, making it challenging for residents to reach essential services without a car.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and the need for affordable transportation options, proposals with lower transit fares and minimal driver fees are prioritized. A lower sales tax is also preferred to minimize the impact on residents' limited discretionary spending. Improving transit times is important, but affordability is the primary concern. Therefore, proposals that offer a balance between reduced travel times and lower costs are ranked higher."
