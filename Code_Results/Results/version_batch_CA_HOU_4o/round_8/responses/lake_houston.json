    "disposable_income": "Lake Houston is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake Houston have a moderate to high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significant improvements in transit service and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing car travel time and improving transit efficiency to encourage a shift from driving to public transit, which can alleviate congestion and reduce emissions. A balance between tax rates and user fees is crucial to ensure that the financial burden is not too high while still improving transit services. Proposals with moderate sales tax and driving fees, coupled with reduced travel times, are prioritized to enhance overall accessibility and service quality."
