    "disposable_income": "Willow Meadows / Willowbend is a middle-income neighborhood with moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, spending on essentials and some luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low while improving transit times. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it results in better transit services. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs for both transit and driving, while ensuring that the financial burden on residents is minimized. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements."
