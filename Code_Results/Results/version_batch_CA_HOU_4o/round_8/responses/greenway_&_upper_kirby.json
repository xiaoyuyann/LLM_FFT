    "disposable_income": "Greenway / Upper Kirby is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greenway / Upper Kirby tend to have higher discretionary spending on luxury goods, dining, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The focus is on balancing improved transit times with reasonable costs, while considering the impact of sales tax on discretionary spending. Proposals with moderate sales tax and improved transit times are prioritized, as they offer a good balance of cost and service improvement. The decision also considers the potential for reduced congestion and emissions, which aligns with the community's interest in sustainability."
