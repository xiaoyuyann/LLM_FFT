    "disposable_income": "The Mid-West neighborhood has a moderate to high disposable income, with many residents employed in professional sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and retail.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driving fees if it results in better services and reduced travel times. The neighborhood's high car ownership suggests that reducing driving times is also a priority. Therefore, proposals that balance a moderate sales tax with reduced travel times and improved transit services are preferred. Proposals with a 1% sales tax are favored as they provide a balance between funding transit improvements and maintaining disposable income for other consumption. Lower transit fares and moderate driving fees are also prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion."
