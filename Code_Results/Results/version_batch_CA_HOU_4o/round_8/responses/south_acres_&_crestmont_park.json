    "disposable_income": "The South Acres / Crestmont Park neighborhood generally has a lower to moderate disposable income level.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing more on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower to moderate disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could benefit those who rely on public transportation. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is also a priority to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, the selected proposals aim to provide affordable and efficient transportation options while considering the financial constraints of the community."
