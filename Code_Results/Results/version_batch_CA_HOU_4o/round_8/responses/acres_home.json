    "accessibility": "Acres Home has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income and discretionary spending in Acres Home, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. Additionally, reducing travel times is important to improve accessibility.
