    "disposable_income": "The Medical Center neighborhood has a relatively high disposable income due to the presence of healthcare professionals and researchers.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Medical Center area have moderate to high discretionary consumption, often spending on dining, entertainment, and healthcare services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a strong reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles due to the presence of the Texas Medical Center.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in sales tax and transit fares if it results in significantly improved transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency, as many residents rely on public transportation to commute to work. A balance between fare, tax, and driving fees is crucial to ensure that both transit users and drivers benefit. Proposals with a moderate sales tax and fare, combined with a higher driving fee, are preferred to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. The top-ranked proposals offer the best trade-off between cost and improved transit times, benefiting the community's overall accessibility and quality of life."
