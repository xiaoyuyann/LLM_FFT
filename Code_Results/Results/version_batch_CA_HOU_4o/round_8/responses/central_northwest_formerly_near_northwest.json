    "disposable_income": "The Central Northwest neighborhood has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and limited luxury spending.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the spread-out nature of services and employment opportunities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this can benefit both transit users and drivers by reducing congestion. The top-ranked proposals balance these factors by offering reduced travel times and costs, while maintaining a reasonable sales tax to support transit improvements."
