    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor / Port Houston has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to lower income levels.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the need for flexible transportation options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, minimizing costs is crucial. Proposals with lower transit fares and driving fees are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents. Additionally, reducing travel time is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and fees, and reduced travel times are ranked higher. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' consumption of essential goods."
