    "disposable_income": "Carverdale has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Carverdale have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Carverdale has moderate accessibility to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the neighborhood.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as this could reduce reliance on personal vehicles and improve accessibility. The selected policies aim to balance cost savings with improved transit efficiency, considering the neighborhood's reliance on both transit and personal vehicles."
