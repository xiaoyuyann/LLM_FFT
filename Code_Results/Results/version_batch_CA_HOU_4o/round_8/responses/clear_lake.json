    "disposable_income": "Clear Lake is a relatively affluent area with a higher than average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Clear Lake have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on leisure, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Clear Lake has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and transit options, though transit times are generally longer.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford a moderate increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, while balancing costs. Proposals with a $0.75 transit fare and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, while maintaining a reasonable sales tax to support transit improvements."
