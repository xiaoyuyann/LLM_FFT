    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in West University Place have a high level of discretionary consumption, often spending on luxury goods, services, and travel.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with many residents relying on personal vehicles for transportation, though transit options are available.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community can afford higher taxes and fees if it results in better services. However, since many residents rely on personal vehicles, policies that significantly increase driving costs may be less favorable. The focus is on balancing improved transit services with reasonable costs, both for transit users and drivers. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to significant improvements in transit services, as the community can absorb this cost."
