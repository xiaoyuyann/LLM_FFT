    "disposable_income": "Central Southwest has a moderate disposable income level, with many residents working in blue-collar and service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community tends to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit access is crucial for many residents, as car ownership is not universal, and transit is a primary mode of transportation for accessing jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels, affordability of transit fares is crucial, so lower fares are preferred. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Driver fees are less of a concern since car ownership is not as high, but reducing congestion and improving transit times are important. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate sales tax, and reasonable driver fees that improve transit times are prioritized."
