    "disposable_income": "Fort Bend / Houston has a moderate to high disposable income level, with many residents having the financial flexibility to absorb slight increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a diverse range of discretionary spending, with residents investing in housing, education, and leisure activities, indicating a need to balance transportation costs with other expenditures.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit, making efficient and cost-effective transportation options crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel time is a priority, as it enhances accessibility and quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage public transit use and reduce congestion. The balance between tax, fare, and fee is crucial to ensure affordability while improving service quality. Proposals with a 1% sales tax and moderate fare and fee adjustments are prioritized to maintain a balance between cost and service improvement."
