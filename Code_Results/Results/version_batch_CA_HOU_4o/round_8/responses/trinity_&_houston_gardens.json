    "disposable_income": "The Trinity / Houston Gardens neighborhood generally has a lower disposable income compared to other areas in Houston.",

    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to limited transit options and longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to ensure affordability. Additionally, reducing travel times is important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate sales tax rates and lower fares and fees are prioritized to enhance transit services without significantly impacting residents' budgets."
