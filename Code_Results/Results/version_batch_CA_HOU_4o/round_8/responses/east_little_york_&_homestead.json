    "disposable_income": "East Little York / Homestead has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents relying on affordable transportation options.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, prioritizing essential goods and services over luxury items.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit is a crucial mode of transportation for many residents, but current transit times are long, and accessibility to resources and services is limited.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's lower disposable income, affordability of transit fares and driver fees is crucial. Reducing transit times is also important to improve accessibility. A balance between a reasonable sales tax and improved transit services is needed. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce transit times are prioritized. The community would benefit from a slight increase in sales tax if it leads to better transit services, but the increase should not be too high to avoid burdening residents financially."
