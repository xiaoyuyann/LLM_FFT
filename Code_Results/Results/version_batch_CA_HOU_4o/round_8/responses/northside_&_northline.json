    "disposable_income": "The Northside / Northline neighborhood generally has a lower to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have limited discretionary spending, focusing more on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, it is crucial to minimize additional financial burdens on residents. Therefore, lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to keep transportation affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Reducing travel time is also important to improve accessibility and quality of life. Balancing these factors, the selected policies aim to provide affordable and efficient transportation options while considering the financial constraints of the community."
