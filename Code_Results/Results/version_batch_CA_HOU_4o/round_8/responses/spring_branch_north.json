    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch North has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with residents spending on essentials and some non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Spring Branch North has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both personal vehicles and public transit for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit users and drivers. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage public transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The community values reduced travel times and costs, so proposals that offer these benefits while maintaining affordability are prioritized. The selected proposals balance these factors, aiming to improve transit efficiency and accessibility without imposing excessive financial burdens on residents."
