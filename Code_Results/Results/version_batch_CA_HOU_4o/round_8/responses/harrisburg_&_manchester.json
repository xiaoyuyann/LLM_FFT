    "disposable_income": "Harrisburg / Manchester has a relatively low to moderate disposable income, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has limited discretionary consumption, with a significant portion of income spent on essentials like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with public transit being a crucial mode of transportation for many residents due to lower car ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs for residents is crucial. A lower transit fare and driving fee are prioritized to reduce the financial burden on residents who rely on public transit. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit can enhance accessibility and reduce travel times. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit efficiency, considering the community's reliance on public transportation and limited discretionary spending capacity."
