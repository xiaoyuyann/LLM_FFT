    "disposable_income": "Minnetex is a lower-income neighborhood, with many residents having limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Minnetex prioritize essential spending, with limited room for discretionary consumption.",
    "accessibility": "Public transit options are limited, and many residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting, though transit improvements could benefit those without cars.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the limited disposable income, policies with lower fares and fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. However, improving transit accessibility is crucial for residents without cars. Balancing these factors, proposals with moderate sales tax and lower fares and fees are prioritized to enhance transit services without significantly impacting residents' budgets. The top choices aim to reduce travel time and costs while supporting transit improvements."
