    "disposable_income": "Westbranch has a moderate level of disposable income, with residents generally able to afford basic necessities but being cautious about additional expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbranch tend to prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to moderate income levels.",
    "accessibility": "Westbranch has moderate accessibility to resources and services, with a reliance on both driving and public transit, though transit times are currently longer.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it is important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. Reducing transit fares and driving fees while maintaining or slightly increasing the sales tax can improve transit services without significantly impacting residents' budgets. The focus is on reducing travel times and costs to enhance accessibility and encourage transit use, which can alleviate congestion and improve overall quality of life. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driving fees, coupled with a reasonable sales tax, are prioritized."
