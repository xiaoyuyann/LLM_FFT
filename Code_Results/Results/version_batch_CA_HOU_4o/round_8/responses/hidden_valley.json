    "disposable_income": "Hidden Valley has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in blue-collar jobs.",

    "accessibility": "Public transit is crucial for many residents, but current services are limited, making accessibility to jobs and services challenging.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, policies with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize financial strain. Improved transit times are also important to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, which improve transit times without significantly increasing costs, are prioritized. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is crucial to ensure affordability and better transit services."
