    "disposable_income": "Afton Oaks / River Oaks is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this neighborhood have significant discretionary spending, often on luxury goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility to resources and services, with a high rate of car ownership and less reliance on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary spending, the community can absorb higher costs if it results in better services. However, the preference is to maintain or improve current travel times and costs. The neighborhood's high car ownership means that policies reducing driving time and cost are favorable. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to encourage transit use without significantly impacting car users. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it improves transit services, as it aligns with the community's ability to support public goods."
