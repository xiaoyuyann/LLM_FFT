    "disposable_income": "The Washington Avenue Coalition / Memorial Park area generally has a higher disposable income compared to other neighborhoods in Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in this area tend to have higher discretionary spending, often on dining, entertainment, and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good accessibility to resources and services, with a mix of transit options and a high rate of car ownership.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, the community can absorb slightly higher costs if it results in better services. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit services, even if it means a moderate increase in taxes or fees. The community values efficient transit options to reduce congestion and improve environmental outcomes. Therefore, proposals with moderate to high driver fees and transit fares, which significantly reduce travel times, are prioritized. A balance between tax rates and service improvements is also considered, with a preference for proposals that enhance transit efficiency without overly burdening residents with high taxes."
