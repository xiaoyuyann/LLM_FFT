    "disposable_income": "Memorial is a relatively affluent area with higher than average disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Memorial have significant discretionary spending, often on luxury goods, dining, and travel.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good accessibility by car, but public transit options are less convenient, leading to a higher reliance on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it leads to improved services. However, a high sales tax could impact discretionary spending, which is a significant part of the community's lifestyle. Therefore, proposals with moderate sales tax and improved transit times are prioritized. The community values reduced travel times and is willing to pay slightly higher fares and fees for better services. Proposals that significantly reduce transit times and moderately increase costs are preferred, as they align with the community's ability to pay and desire for efficient transportation."
