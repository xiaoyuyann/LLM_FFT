    "disposable_income": "Westbury has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income families and some lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Westbury have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services, and some spending on leisure and non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Westbury has decent accessibility to resources and services, but public transit options are limited, making car travel a primary mode of transportation for many residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Westbury's moderate disposable income, it is important to balance the cost of transportation with the benefits of improved transit services. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times. The top-ranked proposals prioritize reducing travel time and cost for both transit and driving, while considering the impact on residents' disposable income and discretionary consumption."
