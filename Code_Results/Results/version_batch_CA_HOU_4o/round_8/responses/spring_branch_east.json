    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch East has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of middle-income and lower-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Spring Branch East have moderate discretionary spending, with a focus on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has decent accessibility to resources and services, but public transit options are limited, making car travel more common.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income, it's important to keep costs low for both transit and driving. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. The focus is on reducing travel time and costs while improving transit accessibility. Proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements."
