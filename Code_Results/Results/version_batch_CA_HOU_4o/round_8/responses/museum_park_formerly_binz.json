    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Museum Park have a higher level of discretionary consumption, often spending on cultural, dining, and recreational activities.",
    "accessibility": "Museum Park has good accessibility to resources and services, with multiple transit options and proximity to major cultural and educational institutions.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary spending, residents can afford slightly higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing travel time and improving transit efficiency, as many residents may prefer public transit for commuting to nearby cultural and educational institutions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as the community values accessibility and reduced congestion. Therefore, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees, which significantly reduce travel times, are prioritized."
