    "disposable_income": "Alief is a diverse community with a moderate to low average disposable income, where many residents are budget-conscious.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Alief prioritize essential spending, with limited discretionary consumption due to budget constraints.",
    "accessibility": "Alief has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of the area and limited transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income in Alief, policies with lower transit fares and driving fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also favored to preserve disposable income for essential goods. However, improving transit times is important to enhance accessibility and reduce reliance on personal vehicles. Therefore, proposals that balance lower costs with improved transit times are prioritized. The top choices reflect a preference for lower fares and fees, with moderate improvements in transit times, while keeping the sales tax at a manageable level."
