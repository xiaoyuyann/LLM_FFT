    "disposable_income": "Brays Oaks has a moderate to low disposable income, with many residents working in service and blue-collar jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Brays Oaks have limited discretionary spending, prioritizing essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the spread-out nature of services and employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, it is crucial to keep both transit fares and driving fees affordable to avoid burdening residents financially. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending on essentials. Improving transit times is beneficial, but not at the cost of significantly higher fares or fees. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driving fees, which also improve transit times, are prioritized. The balance between cost and improved transit service is key, with a slight preference for lower sales tax to minimize impact on overall consumption."
