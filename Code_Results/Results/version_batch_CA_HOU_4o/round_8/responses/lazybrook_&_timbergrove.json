    "disposable_income": "Lazybrook / Timbergrove is a middle to upper-middle-income neighborhood with relatively high disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lazybrook / Timbergrove have moderate to high discretionary spending, often prioritizing quality of life and convenience.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent access to public transit, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to convenience and faster travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income, residents can afford moderate increases in transit fares and driving fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. The focus is on reducing travel times for both transit and driving, while balancing costs. Proposals with moderate fares and fees, and lower sales tax rates, that offer significant reductions in travel times are prioritized."
