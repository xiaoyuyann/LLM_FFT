    "disposable_income": "Greater Greenspoint has a relatively lower average disposable income compared to other Houston neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Greater Greenspoint have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the spread-out nature of resources and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the lower disposable income, minimizing costs for both transit and driving is crucial. A lower fare and driving fee are prioritized to ensure affordability. The sales tax is considered, but a balance is needed to avoid excessive burden on residents. Proposals that reduce travel time are also favored to improve accessibility and efficiency. Therefore, options with lower fares and fees, moderate sales tax, and reduced travel times are prioritized."
