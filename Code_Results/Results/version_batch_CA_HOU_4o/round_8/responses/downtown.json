    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has a high level of discretionary consumption with numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options available.",
    "accessibility": "Downtown has excellent accessibility to resources and services, with a robust public transit network and walkable infrastructure.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, Downtown residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in significantly improved transit services and reduced travel times. The focus is on reducing congestion and improving transit efficiency, as many residents rely on public transportation. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, but a balance is needed to avoid excessive costs. Therefore, proposals with a moderate fare and driver fee, coupled with a reasonable sales tax, are prioritized to enhance transit services while maintaining affordability."
