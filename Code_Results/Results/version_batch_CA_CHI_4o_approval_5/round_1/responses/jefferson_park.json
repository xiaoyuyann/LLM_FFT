    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The community has a relatively stable economic base, but residents are sensitive to increases in living costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jefferson Park have moderate discretionary spending. They prioritize essential goods and services but also value affordable transportation options to maintain their quality of life.",
    "accessibility": "Jefferson Park has good access to public transportation, including the CTA Blue Line and several bus routes. However, many residents also rely on cars for commuting, so both transit and driving options are important.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, policies that balance affordability with improved transit services are preferred. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly burden residents' discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and a balanced tax rate are prioritized."
