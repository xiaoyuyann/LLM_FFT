    "disposable_income": "North Center is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from taxes or fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a high level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services. This suggests that while residents can afford higher costs, they may prefer policies that do not significantly impact their discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "North Center has good access to public transportation, with several CTA bus and train lines serving the area. The community is also car-friendly, with many residents owning vehicles. Therefore, policies that improve transit times and reduce congestion could be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, North Center can absorb moderate increases in taxes and fees. However, residents would likely prefer policies that enhance transit efficiency and reduce travel times without drastically increasing costs. Policies with moderate taxes and fees that significantly improve transit times and reduce driving times are prioritized. The community would benefit from a balanced approach that supports transit improvements while maintaining reasonable costs for both transit users and drivers."
