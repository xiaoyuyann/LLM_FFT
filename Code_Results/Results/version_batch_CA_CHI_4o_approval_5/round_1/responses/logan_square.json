    "disposable_income": "Logan Square has a diverse population with varying income levels. While some residents have higher disposable incomes, there is a significant portion of the community with moderate to low disposable incomes. Therefore, policies that minimize additional financial burdens are preferable.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Logan Square value their discretionary spending on local businesses, dining, and cultural activities. Policies that allow for more discretionary spending by reducing transportation costs would be beneficial.",
    "accessibility": "Logan Square has good access to public transit, with the Blue Line and several bus routes serving the area. Improving transit times and maintaining affordability is crucial for residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's diverse income levels and reliance on public transit, policies that reduce transit fares and maintain or slightly increase driver fees to improve transit services are favorable. A lower sales tax is also preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and lower sales taxes are prioritized. The goal is to enhance transit accessibility and affordability while considering the financial impact on residents."
