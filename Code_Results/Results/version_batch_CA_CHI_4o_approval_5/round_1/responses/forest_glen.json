    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from taxes or fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents in Forest Glen likely have higher discretionary spending. However, they may still be sensitive to significant increases in costs that could impact their lifestyle or savings.",
    "accessibility": "Forest Glen has good access to public transportation, including Metra and CTA services, but many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting. Reducing travel time and improving transit services could be beneficial, but not at the expense of significantly higher costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the community's higher income and reliance on both transit and driving, policies that balance improved transit services with moderate cost increases are preferred. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax increase is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and a balanced tax rate are prioritized."
