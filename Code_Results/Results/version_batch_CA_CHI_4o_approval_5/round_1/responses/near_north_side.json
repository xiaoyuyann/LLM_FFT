    "disposable_income": "The Near North Side is one of the wealthier areas in Chicago, with a higher average disposable income compared to other communities. Residents can generally afford higher costs associated with transportation, but they still value cost-effectiveness.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Near North Side have a high level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and luxury goods. They are likely to be sensitive to changes in disposable income due to increased taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The Near North Side has excellent access to public transit, with multiple CTA train lines and bus routes. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting, but there is also a significant number of car owners who value reduced congestion and travel time.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the high disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community can support moderate increases in taxes and fees if they lead to significant improvements in transit service and reduced congestion. Policies that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are prioritized. A balance between fare, tax, and driving fee is essential to ensure that the community's diverse transportation needs are met without overly burdening any single group. Proposals with a moderate tax rate (1%) and a mix of fare and driving fees that improve travel times are preferred."
