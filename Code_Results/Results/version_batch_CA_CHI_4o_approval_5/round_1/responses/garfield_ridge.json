    "disposable_income": "Garfield Ridge is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but they can absorb moderate increases if they lead to significant improvements in service.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with spending on housing, food, and transportation being significant. Residents are likely to prioritize cost-effective transportation options that do not overly burden their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Garfield Ridge has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit options are available but not as extensive as in more central areas. Many residents rely on driving, so policies that improve transit times and reduce congestion are beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance cost with improved service are preferred. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly enhances transit services. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales taxes are prioritized."
