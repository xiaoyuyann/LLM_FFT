    "disposable_income": "Lake View is a relatively affluent community with a higher than average disposable income, allowing residents to absorb moderate increases in costs such as transit fares and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Lake View have a higher level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and other non-essential goods and services. They may be more sensitive to changes in disposable income that affect their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Lake View has good access to public transportation, with multiple transit lines serving the area. This makes transit a viable option for many residents, although car ownership is also common.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, Lake View residents can handle moderate increases in transit fares and taxes if it results in improved transit services. The community values reduced travel times and better service quality. Proposals with a balance of moderate fare and tax increases, along with driver fees to encourage transit use and reduce congestion, are preferred. Proposals with the highest tax rates are less favorable due to their impact on discretionary spending."
