    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn is a community with a moderate to low average income level. Residents are sensitive to changes in costs related to transportation, as a significant portion of their income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income levels, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, and any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget for non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago Lawn has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit services could enhance accessibility. Many residents rely on public transportation, but there is also a significant number of car owners. Reducing travel time and improving transit services would be beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the community's moderate to low income, policies with lower transit fares and minimal increases in sales tax are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Additionally, policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs are prioritized. A balance between maintaining affordable transit fares and improving service quality is crucial. Therefore, policies with a $0.75 fare and moderate driver fees are favored, as they offer improved transit times and encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions."
