    "disposable_income": "Clearing is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but they can absorb moderate increases if they lead to significant improvements in service.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with residents spending on a variety of goods and services. They are likely to be cautious about policies that significantly reduce their disposable income.",
    "accessibility": "Clearing has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is used, but many residents rely on driving due to the community's layout and connectivity. Improvements in transit times could encourage more transit use.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that balance cost with improved service are preferred. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Therefore, policies with a 0.5% or 1% sales tax, lower fares, and moderate driver fees are prioritized to improve transit times and reduce congestion while maintaining affordability."
