    "disposable_income": "Uptown is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, including both low-income and middle-income residents. The disposable income varies significantly across the community, with some residents having limited financial flexibility.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on essentials and some discretionary items. However, any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Uptown has good access to public transportation, with several bus and train lines serving the area. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting and daily activities, although some also use personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the diverse income levels in Uptown, it is important to keep transit fares affordable while also improving transit services. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary consumption. Driver fees can be used to encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a lower sales tax, are prioritized to balance affordability and service improvement."
