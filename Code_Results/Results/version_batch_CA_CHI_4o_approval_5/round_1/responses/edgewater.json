    "disposable_income": "Edgewater is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, but generally has a moderate disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in costs, especially those that impact daily commuting expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on a variety of goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on other necessities and leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Edgewater has good access to public transit, with several CTA bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times can be long, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial. Car ownership is moderate, and reducing congestion and travel times for drivers is also important.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, policies that minimize fare and fee increases while improving transit times are preferred. A lower sales tax is also favorable to avoid impacting overall consumption. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. The community would benefit from improved transit services without a significant increase in costs."
