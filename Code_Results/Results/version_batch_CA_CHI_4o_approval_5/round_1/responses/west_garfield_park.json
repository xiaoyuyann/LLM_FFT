    "disposable_income": "West Garfield Park is a lower-income community with limited disposable income. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through transit fares, sales taxes, or driving fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the limited disposable income, discretionary consumption is low. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "West Garfield Park has moderate access to public transit, but travel times are relatively long. Improving transit efficiency and reducing costs would benefit residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community would benefit from policies that reduce transit fares and improve travel times without significantly increasing costs. Lower sales taxes and driving fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. Proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driving fees are prioritized to encourage a shift from driving to transit, potentially reducing congestion and emissions. The focus is on balancing affordability with improved transit service."
