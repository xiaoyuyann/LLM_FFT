    "disposable_income": "Auburn Gresham has a moderate to low average disposable income, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Auburn Gresham has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could enhance accessibility. Many residents rely on public transit, so lower fares and improved services are beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community would benefit from policies that lower transit fares and improve transit times without significantly increasing the tax burden. A lower fare would make transit more affordable, and a moderate driver fee could reduce congestion and improve transit times. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, policies with a $0.75 fare, moderate driver fees, and a 0.5% or 1.0% tax rate are prioritized."
