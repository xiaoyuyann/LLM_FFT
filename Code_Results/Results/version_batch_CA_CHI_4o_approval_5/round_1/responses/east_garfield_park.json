    "disposable_income": "East Garfield Park is a community with relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago. This means that residents are more sensitive to increases in costs, such as higher transit fares or driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "East Garfield Park has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit services could greatly benefit the community by reducing travel times and increasing accessibility to jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the low disposable income and limited discretionary spending, policies with lower transit fares and minimal driver fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as better transit can enhance accessibility and reduce reliance on driving. Therefore, proposals with a $0.75 transit fare and a $0.5 driver fee are prioritized, as they offer a balance between cost and improved transit service. A 1% sales tax is acceptable if it leads to noticeable improvements in transit times."
