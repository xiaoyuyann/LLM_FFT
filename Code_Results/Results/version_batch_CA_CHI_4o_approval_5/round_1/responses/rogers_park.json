    "disposable_income": "Rogers Park has a diverse population with varying income levels, but generally, it is a middle-income area. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, especially those who rely on public transit.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption. Residents prioritize essential expenses, and any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Rogers Park is well-served by public transit, including the CTA Red Line and several bus routes. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting and daily activities, making transit affordability and efficiency crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the reliance on public transit and the sensitivity to cost changes, proposals with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred. A lower sales tax is also favorable to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Proposals that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs are prioritized. Therefore, proposals with a $0.75 fare and moderate driver fees, combined with a 0.5% or 1.0% sales tax, are most suitable for Rogers Park."
