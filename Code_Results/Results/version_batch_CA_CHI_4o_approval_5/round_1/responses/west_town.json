    "disposable_income": "West Town is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, but generally has a moderate to high disposable income due to its gentrification and proximity to downtown Chicago.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in West Town have a relatively high level of discretionary consumption, with spending on dining, entertainment, and other lifestyle activities being common.",
    "accessibility": "West Town has good accessibility to public transit, with several bus routes and train lines serving the area. However, traffic congestion can be an issue for drivers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate to high disposable income, West Town residents can afford a slight increase in transit fares and driver fees if it results in better transit services and reduced congestion. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Proposals with a balance of moderate transit fares, moderate driver fees, and lower sales tax rates are prioritized to enhance transit services while minimizing the impact on discretionary consumption. Proposals that significantly reduce travel time for both transit and driving are favored to improve overall accessibility."
