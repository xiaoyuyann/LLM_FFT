    "disposable_income": "South Lawndale is a lower-income community with limited disposable income. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through transit fares, driver fees, or sales taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary consumption is limited. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability of residents to spend on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "South Lawndale has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could benefit the community. Many residents rely on public transportation, so lower fares and improved services are crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community would benefit from policies that minimize costs while improving transit services. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax is preferred to avoid burdening residents with additional costs. Therefore, policies with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a lower sales tax, are prioritized."
