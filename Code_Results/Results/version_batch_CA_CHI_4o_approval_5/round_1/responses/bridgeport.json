    "disposable_income": "Bridgeport has a moderate level of disposable income, with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The community is sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as a significant portion of income is allocated to essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Bridgeport have limited discretionary spending, focusing primarily on essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Bridgeport has decent access to public transportation, with several bus routes and proximity to the CTA Red Line. However, many residents also rely on driving for convenience and flexibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to keep transportation costs low while improving transit services. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fee can encourage transit use without significantly impacting residents' budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it does not overly burden residents. The selected policies aim to balance affordability with improved transit accessibility, considering the community's reliance on both transit and driving."
