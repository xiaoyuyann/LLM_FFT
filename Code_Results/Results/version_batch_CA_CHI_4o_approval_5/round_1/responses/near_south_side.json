    "disposable_income": "The Near South Side is a diverse area with a mix of income levels, but generally has a higher average income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents may have more disposable income to allocate towards transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher average income, residents of the Near South Side likely have a higher level of discretionary consumption. They may prioritize convenience and time savings over cost savings in transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The Near South Side has good access to public transit options, including buses and trains, and is close to downtown Chicago. This makes transit a viable option for many residents, although driving is also common due to the area's proximity to major highways.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community may be willing to accept higher transit fares and driver fees if it results in significant time savings. A moderate sales tax increase could be acceptable if it improves transit services. Policies that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are prioritized, as convenience and efficiency are likely valued by residents. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate costs and improved travel times are preferred."
