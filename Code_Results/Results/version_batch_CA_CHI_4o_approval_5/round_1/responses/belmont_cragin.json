    "disposable_income": "Belmont Cragin is a middle-income community with a significant portion of residents working in blue-collar jobs. The community has a moderate level of disposable income, which means that any increase in transportation costs could impact their budget for other essential expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Belmont Cragin have limited discretionary spending due to their moderate income levels. They prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Belmont Cragin has moderate access to public transit, with some residents relying on buses and trains for commuting. Car ownership is also common, but traffic congestion can be an issue. Improving transit times and reducing congestion would benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and limited discretionary spending, it is important to keep transit fares and driving fees low to avoid burdening residents financially. However, improving transit times and reducing congestion is also crucial. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees that significantly reduce travel times are prioritized. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, as long as it doesn't overly impact residents' budgets."
