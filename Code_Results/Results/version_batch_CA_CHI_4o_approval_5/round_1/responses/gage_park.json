    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class neighborhood with a relatively low median household income compared to other areas in Chicago. Residents are likely to be sensitive to increases in costs, whether through taxes, transit fares, or driving fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Gage Park has moderate access to public transit, with several bus routes and nearby train stations. However, transit times are relatively long, and many residents rely on driving for faster commutes. Improving transit times could encourage more residents to use public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the economic constraints of Gage Park residents, policies with lower transit fares and minimal increases in taxes and driving fees are preferable. Reducing transit times is also a priority to make public transportation a more viable option. Therefore, policies that balance lower costs with improved transit services are ideal. The selected policies aim to minimize financial burden while enhancing transit efficiency, encouraging a shift from driving to public transit, and reducing congestion."
