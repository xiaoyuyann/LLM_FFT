    "disposable_income": "West Elsdon is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on a mix of necessities and non-essential goods. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "West Elsdon has moderate access to public transit, with many residents relying on both transit and personal vehicles for commuting. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are important to ensure accessibility and convenience for residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and reliance on both transit and driving, policies that balance lower fares and moderate driver fees with reasonable travel times are preferred. A lower sales tax is also favored to minimize the impact on disposable income. Therefore, proposals with a 0.5% sales tax, lower transit fares, and moderate driver fees are prioritized. These options provide improved transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents, thus maintaining their ability to spend on other goods and services."
