    "disposable_income": "Norwood Park is a middle to upper-middle-income community with a relatively stable economic base. Residents generally have a moderate to high level of disposable income, allowing for some flexibility in spending on transportation.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on a variety of goods and services. However, they are likely sensitive to significant increases in transportation costs that could impact their overall budget.",
    "accessibility": "Norwood Park has decent access to public transportation, but many residents rely on driving due to the suburban nature of the area. Reducing travel time and improving transit services could encourage more residents to use public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate to high disposable income, a slight increase in sales tax could be acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Lower transit fares would benefit those who rely on public transportation, while a moderate driving fee could help reduce congestion and emissions. Proposals with a balance of lower transit fares, moderate sales tax, and reasonable driving fees are preferred to enhance transit services without overly burdening residents financially. Proposals that significantly reduce travel time for both transit and driving are prioritized to improve overall accessibility."
