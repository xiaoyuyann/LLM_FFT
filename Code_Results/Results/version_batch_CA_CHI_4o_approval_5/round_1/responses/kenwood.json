    "disposable_income": "Kenwood is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, but it generally has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to the University of Chicago and other affluent neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kenwood have a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on education, dining, and cultural activities being significant.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has good access to public transportation, including buses and nearby train stations, making transit a viable option for many residents. However, car ownership is also common due to the convenience it offers.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Kenwood's moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it significantly improves transit services. A lower transit fare would benefit those who rely on public transportation, while a moderate driving fee could encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower transit fares, moderate sales tax, and moderate driving fees are preferred. Proposals with a 0.5% or 1% sales tax, a $0.75 or $1.25 transit fare, and a $0.5 driving fee are prioritized as they offer improved transit times without overly burdening residents financially."
