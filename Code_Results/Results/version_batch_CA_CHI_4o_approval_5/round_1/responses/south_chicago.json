    "disposable_income": "South Chicago has a relatively lower average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. This means that residents are more sensitive to increases in costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary consumption is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "South Chicago has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit services could greatly benefit the community by reducing travel times and increasing reliability. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting and accessing essential services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the lower disposable income and limited discretionary consumption, policies with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize financial strain on residents. However, improving transit accessibility is also crucial, so a balance between cost and service improvement is necessary. Policies with moderate driver fees are acceptable if they significantly reduce travel times and improve transit services, as this could encourage a shift from driving to transit, benefiting the community by reducing congestion and emissions."
