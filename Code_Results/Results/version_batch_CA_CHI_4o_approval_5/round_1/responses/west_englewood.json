    "disposable_income": "West Englewood is a lower-income community with limited disposable income. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs, whether through transit fares, driver fees, or sales taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary consumption is limited. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability of residents to spend on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "West Englewood has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the need to reach jobs and services not easily accessible by transit. Reducing travel time and costs is crucial for improving accessibility.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community would benefit from policies that lower transit fares and maintain low driver fees to minimize the financial burden on residents. A lower sales tax is also preferred to avoid reducing disposable income further. Policies that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are prioritized to improve accessibility. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, lower sales taxes, and moderate driver fees that also offer reduced travel times are favored."
