    "disposable_income": "Avondale is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, but generally, it has a moderate disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, especially those that impact daily commuting expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a moderate level of discretionary consumption. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, and any increase in transportation costs could impact their ability to spend on non-essential items.",
    "accessibility": "Avondale has decent access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times can be long, and improvements in transit efficiency would be beneficial. Car ownership is moderate, and reducing congestion and travel times for drivers is also important.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Avondale's moderate disposable income and sensitivity to cost changes, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize the financial burden on residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services. Reducing travel times for both transit and driving is crucial to enhance accessibility. Therefore, policies that balance lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales taxes while improving travel times are prioritized."
