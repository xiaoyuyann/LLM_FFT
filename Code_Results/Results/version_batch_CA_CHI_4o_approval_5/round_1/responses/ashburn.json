    "disposable_income": "Ashburn is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to increases in costs that could impact their overall budget, especially in terms of transportation expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on essential goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on other discretionary items.",
    "accessibility": "Ashburn has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on driving due to the convenience and time savings. Improving transit times could encourage more residents to switch from driving to public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on both driving and transit, policies that reduce transit fares and improve transit times without significantly increasing taxes or driving fees are preferred. Lower fares and moderate taxes will help maintain discretionary spending while encouraging transit use. Policies with a driving fee could be considered if they significantly reduce travel times and improve transit service, as this could offset the cost through time savings and reduced congestion."
