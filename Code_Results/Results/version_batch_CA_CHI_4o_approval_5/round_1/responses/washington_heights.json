    "disposable_income": "Washington Heights is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for essential and discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on a mix of necessities and non-essential goods. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Washington Heights has moderate access to public transit, with many residents relying on it for commuting. Improving transit times and maintaining affordable fares are important to ensure accessibility and convenience for the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and reliance on public transit, the community would benefit from policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax would minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, policies with lower fares, moderate driver fees, and lower sales taxes are prioritized to balance cost and accessibility improvements."
