    "disposable_income": "Dunning is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in costs related to transportation, as it can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on a mix of necessities and leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Dunning has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit options are available but not as extensive as in more central areas. Many residents rely on driving for convenience and time efficiency.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and balanced discretionary consumption, Dunning residents would prefer policies that minimize additional costs while improving transit efficiency. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are favorable to encourage transit use without significantly impacting driving costs. A lower sales tax is preferred to maintain discretionary spending. Therefore, policies with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a lower sales tax, are prioritized to balance cost and accessibility improvements."
