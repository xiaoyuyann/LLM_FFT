    "disposable_income": "Albany Park is a diverse community with a mix of income levels. The median household income is moderate, suggesting that residents are sensitive to increases in transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Albany Park have a moderate level of discretionary spending. They are likely to be cautious about policies that significantly increase their cost of living, including transportation expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Albany Park has good access to public transit, with several bus and train lines serving the area. However, travel times by transit are longer compared to driving, which may influence residents' preferences for policies that improve transit efficiency.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate income levels and the importance of maintaining affordable transportation options, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred. A lower sales tax is also favorable to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs are prioritized. Therefore, proposals with a $0.75 fare and moderate driver fees, combined with a 0.5% or 1.0% sales tax, are most aligned with the community's interests."
