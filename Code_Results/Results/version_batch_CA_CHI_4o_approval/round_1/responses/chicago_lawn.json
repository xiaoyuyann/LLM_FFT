    "disposable_income": "Chicago Lawn is a community with moderate to low disposable income levels. Many residents may be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, whether through fares, fees, or taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low income levels, discretionary spending is likely limited. Residents may prioritize essential goods and services over additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Chicago Lawn has access to public transit, but travel times are relatively long. Improving transit efficiency and reducing travel times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community would benefit from policies that improve transit efficiency and reduce travel times without significantly increasing costs. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more transit use, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax would minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, policies with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a lower sales tax, are preferred."
