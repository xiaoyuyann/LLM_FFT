    "disposable_income": "North Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but they can accommodate slight increases if it leads to better services.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with residents spending on a variety of goods and services. They are likely to be cautious about policies that significantly reduce their disposable income.",
    "accessibility": "North Park has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and services would be beneficial. Many residents rely on both driving and public transit, so policies that improve transit without drastically increasing costs are preferred.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and balanced consumption, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to maintain affordability. A slight increase in driver fees is acceptable if it significantly improves transit times, as this could encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. Policies with a 0.5% or 1% tax rate, lower fares, and moderate driver fees are prioritized to balance cost and service improvements."
