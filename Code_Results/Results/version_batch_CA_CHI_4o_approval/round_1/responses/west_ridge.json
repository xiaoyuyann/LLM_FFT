    "disposable_income": "West Ridge has a moderate level of disposable income, with a diverse population including middle-income families and a significant number of low-income households.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with residents spending on essentials and some discretionary items, but with limited flexibility for significant increases in transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "West Ridge has moderate accessibility to public transit, with some reliance on driving. Improving transit times could benefit the community, but cost increases need to be carefully managed to avoid burdening low-income residents.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and the need to balance costs, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly increasing costs. A lower sales tax is also preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Proposals that improve transit times without drastically increasing costs are prioritized."
