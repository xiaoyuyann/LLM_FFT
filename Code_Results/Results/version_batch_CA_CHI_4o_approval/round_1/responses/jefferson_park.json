    "disposable_income": "Jefferson Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The community has a relatively stable economic base, with many residents employed in various sectors across the city.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Jefferson Park have moderate discretionary spending power. They are likely to be sensitive to increases in transportation costs, as these could impact their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Jefferson Park has good access to public transportation, including the CTA Blue Line and several bus routes. However, many residents also rely on cars for commuting, given the community's location and the need to travel to different parts of the city for work and other activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income levels and reliance on both public transit and driving, policies that balance affordability with improved transit services are preferred. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more residents to use public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, but it should not overly burden residents' discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a reasonable sales tax, are prioritized."
