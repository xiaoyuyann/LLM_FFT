    "disposable_income": "Portage Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but they can accommodate slight increases if it leads to better services.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced discretionary consumption pattern, with residents spending on a mix of necessities and leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs should not significantly impact their ability to maintain this balance.",
    "accessibility": "Portage Park has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and services would be beneficial. Many residents rely on both driving and public transit, so policies that improve transit without significantly increasing costs are preferred.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate income and balanced consumption, policies with lower fares and moderate taxes are preferred to maintain affordability. A slight increase in driving fees is acceptable if it leads to reduced congestion and better transit services. Policies that improve transit times without drastically increasing costs are prioritized."
