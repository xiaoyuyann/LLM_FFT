    "disposable_income": "O'Hare is a relatively affluent area with a higher median income compared to other Chicago neighborhoods. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from taxes or fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents in O'Hare likely have a higher level of discretionary consumption. They may prioritize convenience and time savings over cost savings, but still value cost-effective solutions.",
    "accessibility": "O'Hare has good accessibility to resources and services, with a major airport and several transit options. However, the area is car-dependent, and reducing driving times could be beneficial. Improved transit services could also enhance accessibility for those who rely on public transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, O'Hare residents might be willing to accept a moderate increase in sales tax and driving fees if it results in significant improvements in transit times and services. Proposals that reduce car travel time and improve transit efficiency without drastically increasing costs are preferred. A balance between maintaining reasonable costs and improving service quality is crucial."
