    "disposable_income": "Washington Heights has a moderate to low average disposable income, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as higher fares or driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, discretionary consumption is limited. Residents prioritize essential spending, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget for other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Washington Heights has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit the community. Many residents rely on public transit, so policies that improve transit efficiency without significantly increasing costs are preferred.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community would benefit from policies that improve transit times and reduce congestion without imposing high costs on residents. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on disposable income. Therefore, policies with a 0.5% sales tax, lower fares, and moderate driver fees are prioritized."
