    "disposable_income": "West Garfield Park is a lower-income community with limited disposable income. Many residents rely on public transportation due to the high cost of car ownership.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the limited disposable income, discretionary consumption is low. Residents prioritize essential expenses such as housing, food, and utilities.",
    "accessibility": "Public transportation is a critical mode of transport for residents, but current transit times are long. Improving transit efficiency is important, but affordability must be maintained.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community needs affordable transit options with improved service times. Lower fares and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use without significantly impacting disposable income. A lower sales tax is preferred to minimize the impact on essential consumption. Therefore, policies with a $0.75 fare, moderate driver fees, and a 0.5% or 1% sales tax are prioritized to balance affordability and service improvement."
