    "disposable_income": "Auburn Gresham has a moderate to low average disposable income, which means residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, taxes, and fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, discretionary consumption is limited. Residents prioritize essential expenses, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Auburn Gresham has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could enhance accessibility. Many residents rely on public transit, so lower fares and improved services are beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community would benefit from policies that lower transit fares and improve transit times without significantly increasing taxes or driving fees. Lower fares would make transit more affordable, and improved transit times would enhance accessibility. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services, but high driving fees could be burdensome for those who rely on cars. Therefore, policies with lower fares, moderate sales tax, and minimal driving fees are prioritized."
