    "disposable_income": "Archer Heights is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for essential and discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on a mix of necessities and non-essential goods. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on other goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Archer Heights has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is a viable option for many residents, but driving is also common. Reducing travel time and improving transit services would benefit the community.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and balanced discretionary consumption, policies that minimize additional financial burdens while improving transit services are preferred. Lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are favorable, as they encourage transit use without significantly impacting budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Policies that reduce travel time for both transit and driving are prioritized to improve accessibility."
