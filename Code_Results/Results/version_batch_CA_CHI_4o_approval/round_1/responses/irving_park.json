    "disposable_income": "Irving Park is a middle-income community with a mix of working-class and middle-class residents. The disposable income is moderate, meaning residents are sensitive to increases in costs that could affect their budget for essential and discretionary spending.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Irving Park have moderate discretionary spending. They value affordability in transportation to maintain their lifestyle, which includes dining, entertainment, and other leisure activities.",
    "accessibility": "Irving Park has decent access to public transit, with several bus lines and a nearby CTA Blue Line station. However, many residents also rely on cars for commuting, so both transit and driving options are important.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the moderate disposable income and discretionary consumption, policies with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize financial strain. However, improving transit times is also important to encourage public transit use. Balancing these factors, proposals with a $0.75 fare and moderate driver fees are prioritized, as they offer improved transit times without significantly increasing costs. A 1% sales tax is acceptable if it results in better transit services, but a 1.5% tax is too high given the community's income level."
