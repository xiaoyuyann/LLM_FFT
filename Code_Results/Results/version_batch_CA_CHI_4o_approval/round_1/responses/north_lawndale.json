    "disposable_income": "North Lawndale has a relatively low average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. Many residents may be sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as higher fares or driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary consumption is likely limited. Residents may prioritize essential goods and services over discretionary spending, making them sensitive to any policy that significantly increases their transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "North Lawndale has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation. However, any increase in costs must be carefully weighed against the benefits of reduced travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community would benefit from policies that improve transit times without significantly increasing costs. Lower fares and moderate driver fees could encourage more residents to use public transit, reducing congestion and emissions. A lower sales tax would also be preferable to minimize the impact on disposable income. Therefore, policies with a $0.75 fare and a $0.5 driver fee, combined with a 0.5% or 1.0% sales tax, are likely to be the most beneficial for North Lawndale."
