    "disposable_income": "Kenwood is a diverse community with a mix of income levels, but generally has a moderate to high disposable income due to its proximity to the University of Chicago and other affluent neighborhoods.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Kenwood have a moderate level of discretionary consumption, with spending on education, dining, and cultural activities being significant.",
    "accessibility": "Kenwood has good access to public transportation, including buses and nearby train stations, but also has a significant number of residents who drive. The community values efficient and reliable transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given Kenwood's moderate to high disposable income, the community can handle a slight increase in sales tax if it significantly improves transit services. Lower transit fares are preferred to encourage public transportation use, but a moderate fare is acceptable if it results in better service. A moderate driver fee is also acceptable to reduce congestion and emissions, as long as it leads to improved transit times. Therefore, policies with a balance of moderate tax, fare, and driver fee that improve transit times are prioritized."
