    "disposable_income": "Gage Park is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income lower than the city average. Residents are likely to be sensitive to increases in costs, whether through transit fares, sales taxes, or driving fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary spending is limited. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact the ability of residents to spend on other essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "Gage Park has moderate access to public transit, but many residents rely on cars for commuting. Improving transit times could benefit those who rely on public transportation, but increased costs could be burdensome.",
    "decision_rationale": "The goal is to balance affordability with improved transit services. Lower fares and moderate driving fees are preferred to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. A lower sales tax is also preferred to minimize the impact on discretionary spending. Therefore, proposals with a $0.75 fare, moderate driving fees, and a 0.5% or 1.0% sales tax are prioritized. These options offer improved transit times without significantly increasing costs for residents."
