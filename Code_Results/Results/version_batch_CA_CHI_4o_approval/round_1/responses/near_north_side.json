    "disposable_income": "The Near North Side is one of the more affluent areas in Chicago, with a higher average disposable income compared to other communities. Residents can generally afford higher costs associated with transportation, but they still value cost-effectiveness.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Near North Side have a higher level of discretionary consumption, spending on dining, entertainment, and luxury goods. They are likely to prioritize policies that do not significantly impact their ability to maintain this lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "The Near North Side has excellent access to public transportation, with multiple transit lines and bus routes. Many residents rely on public transit for commuting, but there is also a significant number of car owners who value reduced congestion and travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the higher disposable income and discretionary consumption, the community can support moderate increases in transit fares and driver fees if it leads to improved transit services and reduced congestion. A balanced approach with moderate sales tax and driver fees, along with reasonable transit fares, would be ideal. Policies that significantly reduce travel time for both transit and driving while maintaining a reasonable cost are prioritized. Therefore, proposals with a 1% sales tax, moderate driver fees, and transit fares that do not exceed the current fare are preferred."
