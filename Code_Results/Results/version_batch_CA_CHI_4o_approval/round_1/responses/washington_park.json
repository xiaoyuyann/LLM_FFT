    "disposable_income": "Washington Park is a community with relatively low disposable income, meaning residents are sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, taxes, and fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary consumption is limited. Residents prioritize essential expenses, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget.",
    "accessibility": "Washington Park has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could enhance accessibility. Many residents rely on public transit, so lower fares and improved services are beneficial.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the low disposable income and limited discretionary consumption, policies with lower transit fares and minimal increases in sales tax and driving fees are preferred. These policies should also aim to improve transit times to enhance accessibility. Therefore, proposals with a $0.75 fare and a 0.5% or 1.0% sales tax, combined with a $0.5 driving fee, are prioritized as they balance affordability and improved transit service."
