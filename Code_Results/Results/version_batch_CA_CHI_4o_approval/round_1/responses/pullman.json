    "disposable_income": "Pullman is a community with moderate to low disposable income levels. Many residents may be sensitive to increases in costs related to transportation, such as higher fares or driver fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the moderate to low disposable income, discretionary consumption is likely limited. Residents may prioritize essential goods and services over discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "Pullman has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit times could significantly benefit residents who rely on public transportation for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering Pullman's moderate to low disposable income, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to minimize financial burden. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents rely on public transportation. Policies that reduce transit times are prioritized to enhance accessibility and convenience for residents. Therefore, proposals with a balance of lower fares, moderate driver fees, and reasonable sales tax rates that improve transit times are favored."
