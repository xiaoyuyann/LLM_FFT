    "disposable_income": "McKinley Park is a middle-income community with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, as these can impact their overall budget for other essential and discretionary expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on a mix of necessities and leisure activities. Any increase in transportation costs could reduce their ability to spend on non-essential goods and services.",
    "accessibility": "McKinley Park has decent access to public transit, but improvements in transit times and reliability could benefit the community. Many residents rely on both public transit and driving, so policies that improve transit without significantly increasing costs are preferred.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and balanced discretionary consumption, policies that maintain or reduce transit fares while slightly increasing driver fees could be beneficial. This would encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions, while keeping costs manageable for residents. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Therefore, policies with lower transit fares and moderate driver fees, combined with a reasonable sales tax, are prioritized."
