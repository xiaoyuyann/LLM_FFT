    "disposable_income": "Dunning is a middle-income community area with a moderate level of disposable income. Residents are sensitive to changes in transportation costs, but they can absorb moderate increases if they lead to significant improvements in service or accessibility.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The community has a balanced level of discretionary consumption, with residents spending on a variety of goods and services. Any increase in transportation costs should be justified by tangible benefits in terms of reduced travel time or improved service quality.",
    "accessibility": "Dunning has moderate accessibility to resources and services. Public transit is used by a portion of the community, but many residents rely on driving. Improvements in transit times could encourage more residents to switch from driving to public transit, reducing congestion and emissions.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's moderate disposable income and balanced discretionary consumption, proposals with lower fares and moderate driver fees are preferred to encourage transit use without significantly impacting residents' budgets. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it leads to better transit services. Proposals that significantly reduce travel times for both transit and driving are prioritized, as they offer the most benefit to the community by improving accessibility and reducing congestion."
