    "disposable_income": "Grand Boulevard has a relatively lower average disposable income compared to other areas in Chicago. This means that residents are more sensitive to increases in costs, whether through transit fares, sales taxes, or driving fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower disposable income, discretionary consumption is limited. Residents prioritize essential goods and services, so any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their budget for other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Grand Boulevard has moderate access to public transit, but improvements in transit services could greatly benefit the community by reducing travel times and increasing reliability. However, the community also has a significant number of car users, so driving fees need to be carefully considered.",
    "decision_rationale": "The community would benefit from lower transit fares to make public transportation more affordable. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, but it should not be too high to avoid burdening residents. Driving fees should be minimal to avoid disproportionately affecting car users. Therefore, proposals with lower fares, moderate sales taxes, and minimal driving fees are prioritized. Proposals that significantly reduce travel times for both transit and driving are also favored."
