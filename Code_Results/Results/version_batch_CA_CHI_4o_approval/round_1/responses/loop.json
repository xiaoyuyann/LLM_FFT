    "disposable_income": "The Loop is a central business district with a mix of high-income professionals and lower-income service workers. Disposable income varies significantly, but there is a substantial portion of residents with higher disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in the Loop have a high level of discretionary consumption due to the presence of numerous dining, entertainment, and shopping options. However, the cost of living is also high, which can impact discretionary spending.",
    "accessibility": "The Loop has excellent accessibility to resources and services, with extensive public transit options including buses and trains. Car ownership is less common due to the availability of public transit and the high cost of parking.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the Loop's strong public transit infrastructure and the presence of high-income residents, policies that enhance transit services while maintaining reasonable costs are preferred. A lower transit fare and moderate driver fees can encourage transit use and reduce congestion. A moderate sales tax is acceptable if it significantly improves transit services, as many residents can absorb the cost. Therefore, policies with a $0.75 fare and a $0.5 driver fee, combined with a 1% or 1.5% sales tax, are prioritized to balance cost and service improvement."
