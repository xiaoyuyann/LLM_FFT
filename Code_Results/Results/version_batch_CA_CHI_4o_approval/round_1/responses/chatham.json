    "disposable_income": "Chatham is a middle-income community with a significant portion of residents relying on fixed incomes, such as pensions and social security. The community is sensitive to changes in disposable income due to limited financial flexibility.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents in Chatham prioritize essential spending on housing, food, and healthcare, with limited discretionary spending. Any increase in transportation costs could significantly impact their ability to afford other necessities.",
    "accessibility": "Chatham has moderate access to public transit, with many residents relying on it for commuting. However, transit times are relatively long, and improvements in transit efficiency could benefit the community. Car ownership is moderate, and driving is a common mode of transportation for those who can afford it.",
    "decision_rationale": "Given the community's sensitivity to income changes, policies with lower fares and taxes are preferred to minimize financial strain. However, improving transit efficiency is also important to reduce travel times. Therefore, policies with moderate driver fees that encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion and emissions, are favorable. Balancing these factors, policies with a 0.5% or 1.0% tax, lower fares, and moderate driver fees are prioritized to enhance transit services without significantly impacting disposable income."
