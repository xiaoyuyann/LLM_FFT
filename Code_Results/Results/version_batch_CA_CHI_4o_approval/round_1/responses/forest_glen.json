    "disposable_income": "Forest Glen is a relatively affluent community with a higher median household income compared to the city average. Residents generally have more disposable income, which allows for some flexibility in absorbing additional costs from taxes or fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the higher income levels, residents in Forest Glen likely have higher discretionary spending on goods and services. However, they may still be sensitive to significant increases in costs that could impact their lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "Forest Glen has good access to public transportation, with Metra and CTA services available. However, many residents also rely on personal vehicles for commuting, given the suburban nature of the area.",
    "decision_rationale": "Considering the community's higher disposable income, a moderate increase in sales tax and driving fees could be acceptable if it leads to improved transit services and reduced congestion. Lower transit fares would benefit those who rely on public transportation, while moderate driving fees could encourage a shift from driving to transit, reducing congestion. Therefore, proposals with a balance of moderate taxes, reasonable transit fares, and driving fees that improve transit times and reduce car travel times are preferred."
