    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has a median household income of around $38,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of income going to basic necessities, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being significant for both transit and driving modes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given low income levels, prioritized proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden. 2) Considered moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3) Balanced travel time improvements against cost increases. 4) Selected proposals that offer meaningful transit improvements while keeping combined tax/fare/fee burden manageable. 5) Favored options that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility for transit-dependent residents."
