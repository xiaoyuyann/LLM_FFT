    "disposable_income": "Lake Houston residents have relatively high median household incomes around $90,000-100,000, with most households having significant disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area's residents generally have comfortable discretionary spending capacity, with many households able to afford private vehicles and higher transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Lake Houston is a suburban area heavily dependent on private vehicles, with limited public transit options and longer travel distances to major employment and activity centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given the car-dependent nature of Lake Houston, policies with lower driving fees are preferred to avoid excessive burden on residents who must drive. 2. Higher sales tax rates are acceptable since the community has good income levels and can better absorb this cost. 3. Higher transit fares are acceptable since transit usage is lower in this area. 4. Prioritized policies that maintain reasonable car travel times while still providing some transit improvements. 5. Selected proposals that balance revenue generation for transit improvements without overly burdening drivers."
