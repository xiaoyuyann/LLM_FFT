    "disposable_income": "Greater Third Ward has a median household income of approximately $23,000, significantly below Houston's average, with about 45% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has relatively good transit access with multiple bus routes and light rail, while about 20% of households lack vehicle access, making transit accessibility particularly important.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, recognizing both transit and car users' needs. 5. Selected policies that provide the best transit service improvements while minimizing financial burden on low-income residents."
