    "disposable_income": "South Acres/Crestmont Park is a lower-middle income community with median household income around $35,000-40,000, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have relatively low discretionary spending power, making them particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited transit coverage with longer transit travel times, and many residents rely on personal vehicles despite the cost burden, while some depend on transit due to economic necessity.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driver fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers 4) Selected policies that achieve meaningful transit time improvements while keeping costs manageable 5) Balanced the need for better transit service with the community's limited ability to absorb additional costs"
