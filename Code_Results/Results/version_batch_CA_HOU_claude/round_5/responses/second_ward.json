    "disposable_income": "Second Ward has a lower median household income around $31,000, with approximately 35% of residents living below the poverty line, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels and high poverty rate, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to increases in taxes, fares, and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good transit access with multiple bus routes and proximity to light rail, while about 20% of households lack vehicle access, making transit accessibility particularly important.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2) Favored moderate sales tax (1%) to balance transit service funding with household budget impacts. 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households. 4) Selected proposals that achieve significant transit time improvements while minimizing cost burden. 5) Balanced the need for system improvements with the community's limited ability to absorb additional costs."
