    "disposable_income": "Memorial is one of Houston's most affluent areas with median household income over $140,000, indicating high disposable income and less sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power with high-end retail centers and shopping destinations, suggesting they can absorb higher taxes and fees with minimal impact on lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit access, featuring good road infrastructure connecting to major employment centers and retail destinations.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency and income levels, prioritize policies that reduce car travel times even if they have higher driving fees 2) Higher sales tax is acceptable given high discretionary spending 3) Transit improvements are secondary but still valuable for service workers 4) Moderate to high driving fees can help fund better transit while encouraging some mode shift 5) Selected policies balance travel time improvements with reasonable fee increases that won't significantly impact the affluent population"
