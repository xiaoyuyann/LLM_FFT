    "disposable_income": "The median household income in East Little York / Homestead is relatively low at around $35,000, with many residents living on fixed or limited incomes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending capacity, with a significant portion of income going to basic necessities like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to longer transit times and limited service coverage.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden. 2. Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility. 5. Select options that maintain reasonable driving costs for car-dependent residents. Based on these factors, prefer proposals with 0.5-1.0% tax rates, lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25), and moderate driving fees ($0.50) that show good travel time improvements."
