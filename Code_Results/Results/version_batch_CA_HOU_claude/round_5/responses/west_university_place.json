    "disposable_income": "West University Place residents have high disposable incomes with a median household income over $250,000, making them less sensitive to transit fares and driving fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has very high discretionary spending capacity with significant retail expenditure and luxury consumption patterns, so sales tax impact is relatively minor.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent road access, high car ownership rates, and limited transit dependency, though it benefits from proximity to major employment centers and the Texas Medical Center.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost sensitivity 2) Support policies that reduce congestion and travel times 3) Higher driver fees acceptable as income allows it 4) Moderate transit fares to maintain service quality 5) Higher sales tax tolerable given spending patterns 6) Selected policies that optimize car travel times (22-23 min range) while maintaining reasonable transit options 7) Final ranking balances maximum time savings with moderate cost increases"
