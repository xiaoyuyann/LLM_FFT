    "disposable_income": "Trinity/Houston Gardens is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, making residents particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With limited discretionary spending power, residents must carefully balance essential needs against transportation costs, and higher sales taxes would notably impact household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit service with longer travel times, and while car ownership is common, many residents are transit-dependent and sensitive to both transit fares and travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as a compromise to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4) Selected proposals that achieve meaningful transit time improvements while keeping costs manageable. 5) Balanced the need for system improvements against the community's limited ability to absorb higher costs."
