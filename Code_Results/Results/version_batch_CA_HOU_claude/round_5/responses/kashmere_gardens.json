    "disposable_income": "Kashmere Gardens is a low-income neighborhood with a median household income around $23,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With nearly 40% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has some bus service but limited transit connectivity, with about 20% of households lacking vehicle access, making both transit affordability and service quality crucial issues.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driver fees ($0.50) that could improve transit service without excessive burden 4) Selected proposals that achieve reasonable transit time improvements while keeping costs manageable 5) Balanced need for transit service improvements with community's limited ability to pay higher taxes and fees"
