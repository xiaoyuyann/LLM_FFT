    "disposable_income": "Sharpstown has a median household income of approximately $38,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of residents being lower-middle income, discretionary spending is constrained and residents are sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate car dependency with some transit access via METRO buses, but many residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting to major employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 2) Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 57 minutes while keeping driving costs manageable"
