    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited public transit options with longer travel times, while 78% of residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting, though many struggle with vehicle maintenance costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited disposable income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers 4) Selected policies that provide meaningful travel time improvements while minimizing cost burden 5) Balanced the need for transit service improvements with the community's limited ability to pay additional taxes and fees"
