    "disposable_income": "Jensen is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $27,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, with most income dedicated to essential needs like housing and food, making them highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed job locations and limited frequent transit service.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited household budgets. 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent workers. 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, recognizing both transit and car users in the community. 5) Selected proposals that provide the best combination of improved transit service while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents."
