    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has relatively high disposable income with median household income over $100,000, indicating residents can generally absorb higher transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power and tend to prioritize quality of life amenities, with many high-end retail and dining establishments in the area.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good road access via I-10 and Memorial Drive, decent bus service, and is relatively close to downtown, though many residents are car-dependent despite some walkable sections.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies that reduce travel times while balancing moderate tax increases, given residents' ability to afford higher costs. 2) Favored options with higher driving fees to reduce congestion, as many residents drive. 3) Selected moderate transit fares to maintain service quality while keeping transit accessible. 4) Considered that higher-income residents can absorb some cost increases if it improves overall transportation efficiency. 5) Weighted travel time improvements more heavily than cost increases given the neighborhood's income levels."
