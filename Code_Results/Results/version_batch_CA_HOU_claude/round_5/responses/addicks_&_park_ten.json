    "disposable_income": "Addicks / Park Ten residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income above $100,000, indicating greater ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area's affluent population has significant discretionary spending power and tends to prioritize convenience and time savings over minor cost differences.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with limited transit options, long commute distances to major employment centers, and most residents rely on personal vehicles for transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency and income levels, policies that reduce car travel time are priority. 2) Higher driver fees are acceptable if they significantly improve travel times. 3) Lower transit fares less critical since transit usage is low. 4) Moderate sales tax preferred to support system improvements while preserving discretionary spending. 5) Selected policies balance travel time improvements with reasonable cost increases given the area's demographics."
