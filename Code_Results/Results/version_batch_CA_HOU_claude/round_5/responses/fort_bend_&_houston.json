    "accessibility": "The area is car-dependent with good road access but limited transit options, though there is growing interest in improved public transportation connections to major employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies that balance moderate tax increases with improved transit service while keeping driving costs manageable given car-dependency. 2) Selected options with lower transit fares to encourage adoption while maintaining service quality through sales tax. 3) Supported moderate driving fees to fund improvements and reduce congestion. 4) Favored proposals showing significant transit time improvements. 5) Considered community's ability to absorb higher taxes given income levels."
