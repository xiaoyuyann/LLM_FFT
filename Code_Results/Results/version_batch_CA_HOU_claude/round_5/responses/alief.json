    "disposable_income": "Alief has a median household income of around $46,000, which is lower than Houston's average, with approximately 17% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels and high proportion of working-class families, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Alief is heavily car-dependent with limited public transit options, though about 15% of households don't own vehicles and rely on METRO bus services for essential trips.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given Alief's income demographics, prioritized proposals with lower transit fares to help transit-dependent residents. 2. Selected moderate tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to balance service improvements with household budget impacts. 3. Supported modest driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Favored proposals that showed significant transit time improvements to benefit working commuters. 5. Considered the balance between car and transit travel times since many residents use both modes."
