    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents working in service and industrial jobs along the Gulf Freeway corridor.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity with most income going to basic necessities, making residents particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has decent bus service along major corridors and is served by the Southeast Transit Center, but many residents rely on personal vehicles for work trips to dispersed job locations.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given low incomes, prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on basic consumption 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to keep transit affordable for dependent riders 3) Moderate driving fees ($0.50) balance revenue needs with cost burden 4) Selected proposals that achieve meaningful transit time improvements while keeping costs manageable 5) Considered that many residents need both driving and transit options due to work patterns"
