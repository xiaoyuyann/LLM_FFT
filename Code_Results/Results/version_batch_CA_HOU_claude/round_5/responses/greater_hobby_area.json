    "disposable_income": "The Greater Hobby Area has a median household income of approximately $45,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower-than-average income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly affected by additional taxes and fees on daily expenses.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the area's proximity to Hobby Airport and industrial employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents while keeping sales tax moderate (1%) to balance revenue needs. 2) Selected policies with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 3) Avoided highest tax rates (1.5%) due to limited discretionary income. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users. 5) Balanced need for transit funding with community's limited ability to pay higher taxes and fees."
