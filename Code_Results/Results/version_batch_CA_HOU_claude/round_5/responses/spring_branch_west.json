    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch West has a median household income of around $55,000, placing it in the middle-income range for Houston, with approximately 15% of residents below poverty level.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity, with most households spending on essential needs first and having some flexibility for additional expenses like transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit options, featuring some bus routes but no direct rail access, and most residents (about 85%) rely on personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the car-dependent nature and middle-income status, policies with lower sales tax burden are preferred to protect discretionary spending. 2) Since most residents drive, moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve overall traffic flow. 3) Lower transit fares are prioritized to encourage transit use as an alternative option. 4) Proposals that balance reduced travel times for both modes while maintaining reasonable costs are favored. 5) Selected policies that don't overly burden either drivers or transit users while providing service improvements."
