    "disposable_income": "Northside Village has a relatively low median household income around $33,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 30% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good METRO bus service coverage but limited rail access, with about 25% of households lacking vehicle access and relying heavily on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent households 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected policies that provide the best transit service improvements while minimizing financial burden on low-income residents"
