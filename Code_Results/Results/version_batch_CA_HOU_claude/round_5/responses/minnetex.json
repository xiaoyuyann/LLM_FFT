    "disposable_income": "Minnetex has relatively low median household income with many residents living below poverty level, making them particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels, with residents needing to carefully budget essential expenses including transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited transit service coverage but relatively high car dependency, with many residents relying on personal vehicles for work commutes and daily needs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited disposable income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more affordable for transit-dependent residents. 3. Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost considerations, recognizing both transit and car users' needs. 5. Selected proposals that offer meaningful transit time improvements without excessive cost burden."
