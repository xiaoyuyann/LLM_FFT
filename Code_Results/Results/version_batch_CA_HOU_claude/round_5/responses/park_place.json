    "disposable_income": "Park Place has a median household income of approximately $38,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households living on modest incomes, discretionary spending is limited and residents are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being a significant concern for the working population.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income residents who depend on transit. 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with household budget impacts. 3) Selected proposals with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users. 5) Focused on options that provide the best balance of accessibility and affordability for the neighborhood's socioeconomic profile."
