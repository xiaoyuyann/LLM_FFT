    "disposable_income": "Carverdale has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels and high cost of basic necessities, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit access with infrequent bus service, high car dependency for work commutes to industrial areas, and relatively long travel times to key destinations.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more affordable for transit-dependent residents 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent workers 4) Sought balance between travel time improvements and cost burden 5) Ranked proposals that provide best transit time improvements while keeping combined costs manageable for low-income residents"
