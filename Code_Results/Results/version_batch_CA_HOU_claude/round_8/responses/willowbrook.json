    "disposable_income": "Willowbrook residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income above Houston's average, characterized by middle to upper-middle class professionals working in healthcare and related sectors near the Willowbrook Mall area.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area shows strong discretionary spending patterns with numerous retail establishments, restaurants, and entertainment venues centered around Willowbrook Mall, indicating residents have significant disposable income for non-essential purchases.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with good highway access via SH-249 and FM-1960, limited bus service, and most residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting to major employment centers including the Texas Medical Center North and surrounding retail/commercial areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency and income levels, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve transit times 2) Higher sales tax is less impactful due to higher disposable incomes 3) Lower transit fares are preferred to encourage occasional transit use 4) Moderate driving fees can help fund transit improvements without severely impacting car-dependent lifestyle 5) Balance needed between maintaining efficient car travel times while gradually improving transit options"
