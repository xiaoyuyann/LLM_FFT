    "disposable_income": "Settegast is one of Houston's lowest-income neighborhoods with a median household income around $27,000, significantly below the city average, indicating very limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With nearly 40% of residents living below poverty level and high unemployment rates, discretionary spending is extremely limited and most income goes to basic necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit service despite high transit dependency, with many residents relying on buses to access jobs and services, and a significant portion of households lacking vehicle access.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given very low incomes, prioritized lowest fares and taxes to preserve household budgets\n2. Selected policies that improve transit service times since many residents are transit-dependent\n3. Supported moderate driving fees to fund transit improvements while not overly burdening car-owning residents\n4. Balanced need for transit investment with community's limited ability to pay higher taxes\n5. Focused on proposals that reduce transit travel times below 55 minutes"
