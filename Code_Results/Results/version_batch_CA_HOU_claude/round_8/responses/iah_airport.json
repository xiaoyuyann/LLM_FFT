    "disposable_income": "The IAH Airport area has moderate to low disposable income levels with median household income below Houston average, as many residents work in airport-related service jobs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs given their income levels.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent due to its suburban location, with limited public transit options despite proximity to the airport, making residents rely primarily on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited disposable income 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.5) over high fees ($1.0) since area is car-dependent 3) Supported lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to make transit more accessible 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden 5) Selected policies that provide reasonable transit improvements without excessive financial burden on residents"
