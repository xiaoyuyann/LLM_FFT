    "disposable_income": "Carverdale has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit access with longer transit times, while most residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting to work in nearby industrial areas and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5%) due to limited disposable income, 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more accessible, 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents, 4) Sought balance between reduced travel times and cost impacts, 5) Considered that many residents must drive for work but would benefit from having affordable transit options"
