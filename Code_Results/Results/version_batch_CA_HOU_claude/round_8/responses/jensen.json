    "disposable_income": "Jensen is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $27,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, with most income dedicated to essential needs like housing and food, making them highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed job locations and limited frequent transit service.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower combined costs (tax + fare + fees) due to limited household incomes. 2. Favored proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to make transit more affordable. 3. Selected moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Avoided highest tax rates (1.5%) due to impact on limited discretionary spending. 5. Balanced improved transit times with cost burden on residents."
