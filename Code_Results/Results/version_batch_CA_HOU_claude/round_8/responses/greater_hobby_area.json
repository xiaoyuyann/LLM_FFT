    "disposable_income": "The Greater Hobby Area has a median household income below Houston's average, with approximately 20% of households living below the poverty line, making residents particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are more likely to prioritize essential expenses over additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the area's proximity to Hobby Airport and industrial employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to support transit-dependent residents. 2) Favored moderate sales tax (1.0%) to balance service improvements with tax burden. 3) Selected proposals with varying driving fees to encourage transit use while not overly burdening car-dependent workers. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users. 5) Balanced overall cost impact on low-income households with service quality improvements."
