    "disposable_income": "Sharpstown has a median household income of approximately $38,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of residents being lower-middle income, discretionary spending is constrained and residents are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good car accessibility with proximity to major highways, but limited transit options with primarily bus service, and about 15% of households don't own vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 2) Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Selected policies that achieve meaningful transit time improvements while balancing costs 5) Considered the mixed-mode transportation needs of the community with both transit-dependent and car-reliant populations"
