    "disposable_income": "Greater Greenspoint has a relatively low median household income of around $33,000, with approximately 30% of residents living below the poverty line, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels and high poverty rate, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit service with bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of households owning at least one car, though transit dependency is higher than city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to support transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that provide best combined benefits for both transit and car users given the mixed-mode nature of the community"
