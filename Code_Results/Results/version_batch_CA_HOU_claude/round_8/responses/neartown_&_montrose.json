    "disposable_income": "Neartown-Montrose residents have relatively high disposable incomes with a median household income around $87,000, significantly above Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has high discretionary spending potential, with residents frequently patronizing local restaurants, bars, retail shops, and entertainment venues in this culturally vibrant area.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good walkability, decent transit access with multiple bus routes, and relatively short driving distances to major employment centers, though many residents rely on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the area's higher incomes, moderate tax increases are acceptable if they improve transit service 2) Many residents drive but would consider transit if service improves significantly 3) A balanced approach with moderate driver fees could help fund transit while not overly burdening drivers 4) Lower transit fares could encourage more ridership among service workers and younger residents 5) Prioritized proposals that reduce both transit and driving times while keeping costs reasonable for both modes"
