    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit accessibility with the Red Line light rail, multiple bus routes, and good road networks, while being close to major employment centers like the Medical Center and Downtown.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies that maintain reasonable transit fares while implementing moderate driving fees to reduce congestion, given the area's mixed-mode transportation needs. 2) Selected options with moderate sales tax rates to support transit without overly burdening retail activity. 3) Favored proposals that achieve significant travel time improvements for both transit and cars, reflecting the multimodal nature of the neighborhood. 4) Considered the area's higher income levels which make residents more tolerant of fees but still sensitive to time savings. 5) Ranked higher those policies that could help maintain the area's strong transit accessibility while managing traffic from the nearby Medical Center."
