    "disposable_income": "Acres Home has a median household income of approximately $35,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate of around 25% and many households being cost-burdened by housing expenses, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate bus service but limited rail access, with many residents dependent on personal vehicles despite the financial burden, and approximately 20% of households lacking vehicle access.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to support transit-dependent residents and those with limited incomes. 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on household budgets. 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users. 5) Selected policies that balance accessibility improvements with affordability for this lower-income community."
