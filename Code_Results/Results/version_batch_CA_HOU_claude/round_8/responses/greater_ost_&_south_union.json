    "disposable_income": "The Greater OST / South Union area has a median household income of approximately $35,000, which is significantly below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate around 28% and many households spending over 30% of income on housing, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent bus service along MLK and OST corridors but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit coverage in residential areas, with approximately 75% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to fund transit while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Sought balance between improved transit times and affordability 5) Ranked proposals that offered best combined benefits for both transit and car users given the mixed-mode nature of the community"
