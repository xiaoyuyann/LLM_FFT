    "disposable_income": "Alief has a median household income of around $46,000, which is lower than Houston's average, with approximately 17% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels and high proportion of working-class families, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Alief is heavily car-dependent with limited public transit options, though it has some bus routes connecting to major employment centers, and about 15% of households don't own vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents and encourage transit use, 2) Selected moderate tax rates (1.0%) to balance service improvements with tax burden, 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to fund transit while not overly burdening drivers, 4) Considered travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transit/driving population, 5) Focused on options that provide best value for lower-income residents while maintaining service quality."
