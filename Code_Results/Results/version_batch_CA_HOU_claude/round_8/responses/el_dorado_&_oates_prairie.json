    "disposable_income": "El Dorado / Oates Prairie is a working-class neighborhood with lower-middle income levels, where households have limited disposable income and are sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have modest discretionary spending capacity and need to carefully balance essential expenses with transportation costs, making them particularly sensitive to both sales tax increases and transit fares.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access but many residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting, with relatively long travel times to major employment centers and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on household budgets 2) Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality 3) Supported modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that provide the best combination of reduced travel times and manageable costs for both transit and car users"
