    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch North has a median household income of around $65,000, placing it in the middle-income category for Houston with moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity but are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees given the area's mix of working and middle-class families.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit options, though it has decent access to major roads like I-10 and Beltway 8, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to preserve discretionary income given moderate income levels, 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) over high fees ($1.00) since most residents are car-dependent, 3) Supported lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage transit use while keeping it affordable, 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, 5) Selected policies that provide meaningful transit improvements without excessive financial burden on driving-dependent residents."
