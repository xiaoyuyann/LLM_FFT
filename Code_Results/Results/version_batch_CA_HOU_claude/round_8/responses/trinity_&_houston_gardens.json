    "disposable_income": "Trinity/Houston Gardens is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity, with a high percentage of income dedicated to essential needs like housing and utilities, making them particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit coverage with longer walking distances to bus stops, and while car ownership is necessary for many residents, maintaining a vehicle represents a significant financial burden.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain transit affordability for transit-dependent residents, 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5%-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited household budgets, 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) as a compromise to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers, 4) Selected proposals that achieve reasonable transit time improvements while minimizing cost burden on residents, 5) Balanced the need for system improvements with the community's limited ability to absorb additional costs."
