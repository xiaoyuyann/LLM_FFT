    "disposable_income": "Clinton Park / Tri-Community is a lower-income neighborhood with median household income around $25,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate and limited disposable income, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit options despite relatively high transit dependency, with many residents relying on bus service for essential trips while car ownership rates are lower than city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as most residents use transit 4) Balanced improved transit times with cost burden 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit service improvements while keeping combined costs manageable for low-income residents"
