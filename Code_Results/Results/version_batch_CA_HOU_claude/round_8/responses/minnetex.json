    "disposable_income": "Minnetex has relatively low median household income with many residents living below poverty level, making them particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels, with residents needing to carefully budget for essential needs including transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited transit service coverage and high car dependency, with many residents relying on personal vehicles despite the financial burden.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more accessible for low-income residents. 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5%-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4) Selected proposals that offer meaningful transit time improvements to make it a viable alternative. 5) Balanced the need for better transit service with the community's limited ability to pay higher taxes and fees."
