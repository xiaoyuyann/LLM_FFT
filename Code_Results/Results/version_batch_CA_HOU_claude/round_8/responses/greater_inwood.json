    "disposable_income": "Greater Inwood has a median household income of around $45,000, which is lower than Houston's average, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and higher poverty rates than city average, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to both transit fares and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but is largely car-dependent, with about 80% of residents commuting by car and facing significant travel times to employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares and moderate sales tax to help lower-income residents who rely on transit. 2) Selected policies with moderate driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, favoring proposals that reduce transit travel times without excessive fees. 4) Considered that many residents make multiple trips per day, so per-trip costs significantly impact household budgets. 5) Chose proposals that provide meaningful transit improvements while keeping combined tax/fee burden manageable for working families."
