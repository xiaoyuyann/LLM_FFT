    "disposable_income": "Northside/Northline is a working-class neighborhood with median household income around $36,000, significantly below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower income levels and higher poverty rates, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent bus service and METRORail Red Line access, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed job locations and limited transit coverage to some destinations.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with tax burden 3) Selected moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and driving given mixed-mode usage 5) Balanced overall cost impact on low-income residents while maintaining service quality"
