    "disposable_income": "Sunnyside has a median household income of approximately $33,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate of around 35% and limited disposable income, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "Sunnyside is heavily car-dependent with limited public transit options, though about 20% of households don't own vehicles and rely on transit, making both transit improvement and affordability crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to fund transit improvements without overly burdening drivers 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that provide the best transit service improvements while minimizing financial burden on low-income residents"
