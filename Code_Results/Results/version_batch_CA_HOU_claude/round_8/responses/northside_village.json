    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of households owning cars while also having significant transit-dependent population.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored moderate sales tax (1%) to balance transit funding with household budget impacts 3) Selected moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users 5) Ranked proposals that offer best combined benefits for mixed-mode community"
