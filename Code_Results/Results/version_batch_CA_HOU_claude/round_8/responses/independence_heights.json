    "disposable_income": "Independence Heights has a relatively low median household income of around $33,000, with approximately 30% of residents living below the poverty line, making residents particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and must carefully balance essential needs with transportation expenses.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 70% of households owning cars despite the financial burden.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax to preserve disposable income. 2) Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3) Balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts. 4) Favor proposals that reduce transit travel times to enhance mobility for transit-dependent residents. 5) Selected proposals 6, 7, 0, 2, 10 as they offer the best combination of affordable transit fares, moderate tax burden, and improved service levels."
