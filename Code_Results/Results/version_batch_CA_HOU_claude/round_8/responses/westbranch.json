    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have modest discretionary spending capacity, with typical household retail spending around $20,000 annually, making them somewhat sensitive to sales tax changes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good road access but limited transit service, with about 70% of residents commuting by car and 20% by transit, suggesting a need to balance driving and transit improvements.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with moderate tax rates (1%) to balance revenue needs with household budgets, 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to support transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality, 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion without overly burdening car-dependent residents, 4) Considered travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transportation needs, 5) Selected proposals that provide good transit service while keeping overall costs manageable for middle-income households"
