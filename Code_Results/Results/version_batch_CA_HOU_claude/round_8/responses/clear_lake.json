    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit options, longer distances to downtown, and most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting to major employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) since residents make significant retail purchases 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without severely impacting car-dependent lifestyle 3) Supported moderate transit fares ($1.25) to balance service quality with accessibility 4) Selected policies that achieve meaningful travel time reductions for both modes 5) Considered the area's high car ownership rates and limited existing transit infrastructure"
