    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor/Port Houston is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 30% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has some bus service but limited transit infrastructure overall, with many residents relying on personal vehicles despite the financial burden, and about 15% of households lacking vehicle access.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited household incomes 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 57 minutes"
