    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch East has a median household income of around $48,000, which is slightly below Houston's median, indicating moderate disposable income levels with some budget constraints.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has moderate discretionary spending capacity, with many working-class and middle-income families who need to carefully balance transportation costs with other essential expenses.",
    "accessibility": "The area has decent car accessibility but limited transit options, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting, though there is some bus service along major corridors.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given moderate income levels, prioritized lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to preserve disposable income. 2) Selected proposals with moderate driving fees ($0.5) to balance revenue generation with affordability. 3) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage transit use while keeping it accessible. 4) Considered travel time improvements, particularly for driving since most residents are car-dependent. 5) Balanced overall cost burden across taxes, fares, and fees to minimize impact on household budgets."
