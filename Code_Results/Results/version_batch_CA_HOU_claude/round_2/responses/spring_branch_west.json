    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch West has a median household income of around $55,000, placing it in the middle-income range for Houston, with approximately 15% of residents below poverty level.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity, with most households spending significant portions on housing, transportation, and basic necessities, leaving limited flexibility for additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited public transit options, featuring some bus routes but no direct rail access, and about 85% of residents commute by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the car-dependent nature and middle-income status, prioritized proposals with lower sales tax to preserve discretionary income. 2) Selected moderate driving fees to encourage transit use without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3) Favored lower transit fares to make public transit more attractive for those who could switch. 4) Balanced travel time improvements against cost increases. 5) Considered that most residents currently drive but might switch to transit if service improves and costs remain reasonable."
