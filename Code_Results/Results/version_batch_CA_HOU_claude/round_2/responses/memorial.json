    "disposable_income": "Memorial is one of Houston's most affluent areas with median household income over $140,000, indicating high disposable income and less price sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power with high-end retail centers and shopping destinations, suggesting they can absorb higher taxes and fees with minimal impact on lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with good road infrastructure, longer distances to transit stops, and higher car ownership rates than city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency and income levels, policies with higher driving fees are acceptable if they reduce congestion and travel times 2) Higher sales tax is less impactful due to high disposable income 3) Transit fare levels matter less since most residents drive 4) Prioritized policies that significantly reduce car travel times 5) Selected proposals that balance revenue generation for system improvements while maintaining reasonable costs 6) Ranked choices that provide the best car travel time improvements while keeping total costs manageable"
