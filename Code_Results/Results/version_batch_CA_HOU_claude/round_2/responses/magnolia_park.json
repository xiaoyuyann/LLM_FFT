    "disposable_income": "Magnolia Park has a relatively low median household income of around $35,000, with many residents working in service and industrial sectors along the Houston Ship Channel.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity with approximately 30% of residents living below poverty level, making residents particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles for work trips to industrial areas, with an average car ownership of 1.5 vehicles per household.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income residents who depend on transit. 2. Favor lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 3. Accept moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent workers. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost burden on residents. 5. Consider proposals that maintain reasonable transit service while minimizing total cost impact on household budgets."
