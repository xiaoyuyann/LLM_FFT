    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor/Port Houston is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income of approximately $35,000, significantly below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households living near or below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited, making residents particularly sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles for work commutes, particularly to the port area and industrial zones, while about 15% of households don't own vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited household incomes 3) Accepted moderate driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent workers 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 57 minutes to benefit bus commuters"
