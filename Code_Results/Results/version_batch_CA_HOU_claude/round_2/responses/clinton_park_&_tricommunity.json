    "disposable_income": "Clinton Park / Tri-Community is a lower-income neighborhood with median household income around $25,000, significantly below Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending capacity, with most income going to essential needs like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit service despite being relatively close to downtown, with many residents dependent on personal vehicles or transit for work commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden. 2. Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit service without excessive burden on drivers. 3. Balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time to help transit-dependent residents. 5. Selected proposals 6, 0, 7, 15, and 16 as they offer the best combination of lower costs and improved service for this low-income community."
