    "disposable_income": "Second Ward has a median household income of approximately $31,000, significantly lower than Houston's average, with about 40% of households living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good METRO bus coverage, relatively close proximity to downtown, and about 20% of households don't own vehicles, making transit accessibility crucial.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) due to high transit dependency and low income levels. 2. Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with tax burden. 3. Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent households. 4. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility to jobs and services. 5. Considered the combined impact of taxes, fares, and fees on household budgets."
