    "disposable_income": "Lake Houston residents have relatively high median household incomes around $90,000, with most households being middle to upper-middle class homeowners.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending capacity but are car-dependent for most activities, with typical suburban consumption patterns including retail, restaurants, and entertainment.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited public transit options, characterized by suburban development patterns with longer distances to employment centers and amenities.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given the suburban nature and high car dependency, policies with lower driving fees are preferred to avoid excessive burden on residents. 2. Lower sales tax rates are favored since residents make significant retail purchases. 3. Higher transit fares are acceptable since transit usage is low. 4. Moderate improvements in transit service are sufficient given current travel patterns. 5. Selected policies balance maintaining reasonable driving costs while funding basic transit improvements."
