    "disposable_income": "Pleasantville Area has a median household income of around $35,000, which is lower than Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and high cost of living, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent bus service but limited rail access, with about 30% of households lacking personal vehicles and relying heavily on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize lower transit fares and taxes to maintain affordability. 2. Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3. Balance between transit improvement and cost burden on residents. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel time to benefit transit-dependent population. 5. Select options that maintain reasonable driving costs for working families who depend on cars."
