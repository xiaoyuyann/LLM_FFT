    "disposable_income": "Lawndale/Wayside has a median household income of approximately $36,000, which is significantly below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of income spent on basic necessities and a poverty rate above 25%, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of households owning cars while facing relatively long commute times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden 5) Selected proposals that provide the best transit time improvements while keeping overall costs manageable for low-income residents"
