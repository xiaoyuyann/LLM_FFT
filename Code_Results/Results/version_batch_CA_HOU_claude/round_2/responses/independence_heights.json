    "disposable_income": "Independence Heights has a median household income of approximately $33,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 35% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate bus service coverage but limited rail access, with about 30% of households lacking vehicle access and relying heavily on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) due to high transit dependency and low incomes. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden on low-income residents. 5. Selected proposals that provide best transit service improvements while minimizing total cost impact on residents."
