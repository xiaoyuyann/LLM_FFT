    "disposable_income": "Greater Uptown residents have relatively high disposable incomes with a median household income well above Houston's average, indicating greater ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has high discretionary spending power with numerous luxury retail establishments and high-end restaurants, suggesting residents can manage higher taxes and fees with less impact on essential spending.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good road infrastructure with proximity to major highways, moderate transit access via METRO buses, and high car ownership rates, though it experiences significant traffic congestion during peak hours.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high incomes, prioritized policies that reduce travel times over cost savings 2) Selected options with higher driver fees to reduce congestion in this dense commercial area 3) Balanced higher taxes against improved transit service since many workers commute into the area 4) Considered that many residents can absorb higher costs but value time savings 5) Weighted policies that could reduce peak-hour congestion through mode shift"
