    "disposable_income": "Jensen has a median household income of approximately $31,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 30% of residents living below poverty line, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to irregular transit schedules and longer travel times to reach employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income residents who depend on transit. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 57 minutes. 5. Balanced need for improved service with community's limited ability to pay additional taxes and fees."
