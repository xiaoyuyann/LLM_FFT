    "disposable_income": "Brays Oaks has a median household income of approximately $41,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of residents living on modest incomes and about 25% below poverty level, discretionary spending is limited and residents are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being significant concern for the working population.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect limited discretionary income 2) Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Selected proposals that offer best balance of reduced travel times for both transit and car users 5) Weighted proposals that minimize combined impact of taxes, fares, and fees on household budgets"
