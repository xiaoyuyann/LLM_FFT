    "disposable_income": "Settegast is one of Houston's lowest-income neighborhoods with a median household income around $27,000, significantly below the city average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high poverty rates and limited disposable income, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit service despite high transit dependency, with many residents relying on buses to access jobs and services, while car ownership rates are lower than city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lowest combined costs given limited incomes - favor low fares and taxes. 2. Need improved transit service but must balance with affordability. 3. Lower driving fees preferred since many essential workers need cars. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times. 5. Selected proposals 6, 0, 7, 15, 2 as they offer best balance of improved service with minimal cost burden - proposal 6 ranked first with lowest combined costs while still improving transit."
