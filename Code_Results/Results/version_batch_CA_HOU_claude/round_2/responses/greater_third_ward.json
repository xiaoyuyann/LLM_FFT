    "disposable_income": "Greater Third Ward has a median household income of approximately $23,000, significantly below Houston's average, with about 45% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has relatively good transit access with multiple bus routes and proximity to light rail, while about 20% of households lack access to a personal vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain accessibility. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to fund transit while encouraging mode shift. 4. Balance between improved transit times and cost burden on residents. 5. Selected proposals that offer best transit travel time improvements while keeping fares affordable."
