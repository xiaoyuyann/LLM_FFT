    "disposable_income": "East Houston has a median household income of approximately $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate and lower income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit coverage but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed employment locations and limited frequent transit service.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income transit users. 2. Favor lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Accept moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost increases. 5. Consider proposals that provide the best transit service improvements while minimizing financial burden on residents."
