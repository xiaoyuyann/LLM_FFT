    "disposable_income": "Park Place has a median household income of approximately $38,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",

    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of households owning cars for work commutes and essential trips.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given low income levels, prioritized lower transit fares and sales tax to preserve household budgets. 2) Selected policies that balance driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3) Favored proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit transit-dependent residents. 4) Considered moderate driving fees to fund improvements while keeping combined costs manageable. 5) Prioritized options that provide the best transit time improvements for the lowest combined cost burden."
