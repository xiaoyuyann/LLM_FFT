    "disposable_income": "Clear Lake residents have relatively high disposable income with median household income around $80,000, significantly above Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area shows strong discretionary spending capacity with high retail activity and numerous shopping centers, indicating residents can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit options, longer distances to downtown, and most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting to major employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency and income levels, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve transit 2. Higher sales tax is less impactful due to higher incomes 3. Lower transit fares are preferred to encourage transit adoption 4. Need to balance driving costs since most residents currently drive 5. Prioritize policies that reduce overall travel times for both modes 6. Selected policies that maintain reasonable driving costs while improving transit service 7. Final ranking optimizes for reduced travel times while keeping combined tax/fee burden moderate"
