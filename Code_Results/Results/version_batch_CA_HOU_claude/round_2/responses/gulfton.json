    "disposable_income": "Gulfton residents have relatively low disposable income with a median household income around $31,000, significantly below Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high poverty rates and dense apartment living, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "Gulfton is heavily transit-dependent with lower car ownership rates, high bus ridership, and many residents relying on public transportation for work commutes and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to fund transit improvements while discouraging car traffic. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times most effectively. 5. Balance between service improvements and cost burden on low-income residents."
