    "disposable_income": "El Dorado / Oates Prairie is a lower-middle income area with median household income around $45,000, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have modest discretionary spending capacity, with most income dedicated to essential needs like housing and utilities, making them sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit access with residents heavily dependent on personal vehicles, though some use bus services for commuting to work centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given limited income, prioritized lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on household budgets. 2) Selected moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality. 3) Supported modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5) Focused on proposals that reduce transit travel times below 57 minutes while keeping driving costs manageable."
