    "disposable_income": "Greater Greenspoint has a relatively low median household income of around $33,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 30% of residents living below poverty level and high housing cost burden, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit service with multiple bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed employment locations, with about 75% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income transit users 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to fund transit while not overly burdening car-dependent workers 4) Sought balance between improved transit times and affordability 5) Considered that many residents make multiple trips per day, making per-trip costs particularly impactful"
