    "disposable_income": "Addicks / Park Ten residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income above $100,000, indicating greater ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area's affluent population has significant discretionary spending capacity and tends to prioritize convenience and time savings over cost savings.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with limited transit access, featuring major employment centers and retail along I-10 corridor where most residents rely on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency and income levels, policies with moderate-to-high driving fees are acceptable if they reduce congestion and travel times 2) Higher sales tax is tolerable given discretionary spending capacity if it improves overall transportation system 3) Transit fare levels are less critical since transit usage is low 4) Prioritized policies that significantly reduce car travel times while keeping total costs reasonable 5) Selected proposals that balance revenue generation for system improvements with maintaining reasonable user costs"
