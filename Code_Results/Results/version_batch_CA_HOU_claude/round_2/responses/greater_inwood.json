    "disposable_income": "Greater Inwood has a median household income of approximately $45,000, which is lower than Houston's average, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and higher poverty rates than city average, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to both sales tax and transit fares.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but is largely car-dependent, with about 80% of residents commuting by car and facing significant travel times to employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income, 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without excessive burden on car-dependent residents, 3) Selected lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable, 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, 5) Considered the high car dependency while maintaining transit affordability for non-car owners."
