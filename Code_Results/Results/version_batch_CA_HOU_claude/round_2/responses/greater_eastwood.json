    "accessibility": "The area has decent bus service along major corridors and relatively close proximity to downtown, with about 20% of residents using public transit for commuting while many still rely on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to support transit-dependent residents and encourage ridership 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with tax burden 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion while not overly burdening drivers 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and driving 5) Selected proposals that provide good transit service while maintaining affordability for mixed-income community"
