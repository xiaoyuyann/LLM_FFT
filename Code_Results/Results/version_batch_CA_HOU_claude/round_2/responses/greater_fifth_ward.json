    "disposable_income": "Greater Fifth Ward has a median household income of approximately $33,000, significantly below Houston's average, with about 40% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, with most income dedicated to essential needs like housing, utilities, and basic necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has relatively high transit dependency with lower car ownership rates, multiple bus routes but limited rail access, and approximately 30% of households don't own vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize lowest transit fares and sales tax burden. 2. High transit dependency means better transit service is crucial. 3. Driver fees are less impactful since car ownership is lower. 4. Need balance between service quality and affordability. 5. Selected policies that minimize transit fares while maintaining reasonable service levels. 6. Ranked proposals with 0.5-1.0% tax rates higher as 1.5% would be too burdensome. 7. Preferred $0.75 transit fare options to keep transit affordable. 8. Accepted moderate driver fees as they improve transit service while affecting fewer residents."
