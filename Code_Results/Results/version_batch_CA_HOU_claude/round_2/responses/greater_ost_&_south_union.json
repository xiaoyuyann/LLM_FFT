    "disposable_income": "The median household income in Greater OST/South Union is relatively low at approximately $33,000, with about 28% of residents living below the poverty line, making residents particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and must carefully balance essential needs with transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of households owning at least one car, while approximately 15% of households depend entirely on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored moderate sales tax (1%) to balance transit funding with household budget impacts 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users 5) Selected policies that provide the best balance of accessibility and affordability for this lower-income community"
