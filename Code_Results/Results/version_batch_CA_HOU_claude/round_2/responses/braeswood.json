    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high income levels, prioritize policies that reduce travel time over cost savings 2) Support moderate tax increases that improve transit service while maintaining reasonable fares 3) Accept higher driving fees to reduce congestion since most residents can afford it 4) Balance between transit improvements and driving efficiency since many residents use both modes 5) Consider policies that provide the best overall time savings across both modes"
