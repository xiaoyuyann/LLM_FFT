    "disposable_income": "Trinity/Houston Gardens is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity, with many households spending a large portion of income on basic necessities like housing, utilities, and food.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit coverage with longer travel times, and while car ownership rates are lower than city average, many residents rely on personal vehicles due to inadequate transit options.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more affordable for low-income residents. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited household budgets. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Selected policies that provide reasonable transit travel times while keeping costs manageable. 5. Balanced the need for transit improvements with the community's limited ability to pay higher taxes and fees."
