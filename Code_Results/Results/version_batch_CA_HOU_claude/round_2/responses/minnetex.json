    "disposable_income": "Minnetex has relatively low median household income with many residents living below poverty level, making them particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity with most income going to basic necessities, suggesting residents would be significantly impacted by increased taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited transit service coverage but high car dependency, with many residents relying on personal vehicles for work commutes and daily needs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5%) due to limited household incomes. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more accessible. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements against cost increases. 5. Selected proposals that minimize overall financial burden while maintaining reasonable service levels."
