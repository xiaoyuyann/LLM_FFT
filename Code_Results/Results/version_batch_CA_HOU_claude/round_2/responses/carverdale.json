    "disposable_income": "Carverdale has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity with most income allocated to essential needs like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "Limited transit service despite being near industrial areas, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritize lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited household incomes. 2. Favor moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality. 3. Accept moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise between maintaining car accessibility and funding transit improvements. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts on household budgets. 5. Consider proposals that provide best combined car-transit accessibility given high car dependency but need for transit options."
