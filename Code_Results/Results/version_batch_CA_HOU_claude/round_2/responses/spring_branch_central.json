    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch Central has a median household income of around $55,000, placing it in the middle-income category for Houston with moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity but are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees given the area's mixed working and middle-class demographic.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good road access but limited transit service, with most residents (85%) relying on personal vehicles for commuting while a smaller portion uses public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency, prioritized proposals with lower driving fees and moderate taxes to avoid excessive burden on drivers. 2) Selected proposals that balance transit improvements with cost impacts, considering the moderate income levels. 3) Favored 0.5-1.0% tax rates over 1.5% to limit impact on discretionary spending. 4) Prioritized proposals that reduce both car and transit travel times while keeping combined costs manageable. 5) Considered that improved transit service could benefit the working-class segment while not overly burdening car-dependent residents."
