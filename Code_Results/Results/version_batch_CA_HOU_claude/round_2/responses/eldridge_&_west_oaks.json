    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the high car dependency and income levels, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve traffic flow 2) Higher sales tax is less burdensome given the area's income levels 3) Transit improvements should be supported but aren't primary concern given current usage patterns 4) Moderate to higher transit fares are acceptable since most residents drive 5) Focus on reducing car travel times since that affects most residents 6) Selected policies that balance traffic reduction with reasonable cost increases"
