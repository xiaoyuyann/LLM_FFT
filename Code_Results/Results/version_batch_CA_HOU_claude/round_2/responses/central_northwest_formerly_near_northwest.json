    "disposable_income": "Central Northwest has a median household income around $45,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating moderate to limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of income going to basic needs and a higher-than-average poverty rate, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times slightly above the city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given limited disposable income, prioritize lower taxes and fares while maintaining service quality. 2. Balance between transit improvements and driving costs since many residents use both modes. 3. Favor proposals with 0.5-1.0% tax rates as 1.5% would be too burdensome. 4. Consider moderate driving fees to fund transit without excessive impact on drivers. 5. Select proposals that reduce transit travel time while keeping fares affordable."
