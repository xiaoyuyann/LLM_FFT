    "disposable_income": "Hidden Valley residents have moderate to low disposable income with a median household income around $45,000, indicating sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has limited discretionary spending capacity, with most income going to essential needs like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with bus routes but relies heavily on personal vehicles, with about 85% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low disposable income, prioritize lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to preserve purchasing power. 2. With high car dependency, avoid highest driving fees to prevent excessive burden. 3. Balance transit improvements with cost impact - moderate fares ($1.25) acceptable if they improve service. 4. Consider proposals that reduce car travel time since most residents drive. 5. Selected proposals 7, 10, 2, 0, 3 as they offer good balance of improved transit service and driving times while keeping costs manageable for residents."
