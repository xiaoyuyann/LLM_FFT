    "disposable_income": "Alief has a median household income of around $46,000, which is lower than Houston's average, with approximately 17% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Alief is heavily car-dependent with limited public transit options, though it has some bus routes connecting to major employment centers, and about 15% of households don't own vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given lower incomes, prioritize proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to preserve purchasing power. 2. Consider lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents. 3. Accept moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that offer best combination of reduced transit times while keeping costs manageable for both drivers and transit users."
