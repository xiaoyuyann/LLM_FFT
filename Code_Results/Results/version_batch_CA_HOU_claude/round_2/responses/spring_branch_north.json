    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch North has a median household income of around $65,000, placing it in the middle-income range for Houston with moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity but are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees given the area's mix of working and middle-class families.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit options, though it has decent access to major roads like I-10 and Beltway 8, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given the car-dependent nature and moderate income levels, policies with lower driving fees are preferred to avoid excessive burden on drivers. 2. A moderate sales tax (1.0%) provides balance between transit funding and tax burden. 3. Lower transit fares are prioritized to encourage transit use as an alternative. 4. Policies that achieve significant travel time reductions without maximum fees are favored. 5. The combination should maintain reasonable accessibility while not overly impacting discretionary spending through fees and taxes."
