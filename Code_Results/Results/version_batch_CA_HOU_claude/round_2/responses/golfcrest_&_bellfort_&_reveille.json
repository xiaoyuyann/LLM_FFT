    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has a median household income of around $38,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households living below poverty level and high housing cost burden, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being higher than city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given low income levels, prioritized lower transit fares and sales tax to preserve disposable income 2) Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 3) Balanced approach needed between transit improvement and cost burden 4) Selected policies that reduce transit travel times without excessive costs 5) Considered that many residents use both transit and cars, so looked for options benefiting both modes"
