    "disposable_income": "The Greater OST / South Union area has a median household income of approximately $35,000, which is significantly below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate around 28% and many households spending a large portion of income on basic necessities, discretionary spending capacity is quite limited for most residents.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of households having access to a car while facing relatively long commute times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income residents who depend on transit; 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income; 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as a compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent households; 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users given the mixed-mode transportation needs; 5) Selected proposals that balance revenue generation for transit improvements with affordability for this lower-income community."
