    "disposable_income": "Fourth Ward residents have relatively low disposable income with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high housing costs consuming a large portion of income and 30% poverty rate, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to additional fees and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good transit access being close to downtown with multiple bus routes, but also high car dependency with 75% of residents commuting by car due to job locations and convenience.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income residents who rely on transit, 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers, 3) Selected lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income, 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden on residents, 5) Considered both transit and driving needs given mixed transportation patterns in the area."
