    "disposable_income": "Trinity/Houston Gardens is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity, with a high percentage of income dedicated to essential needs like housing and utilities, making them particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit coverage with longer walking distances to bus stops, and while many residents own cars due to necessity, the neighborhood experiences relatively high transportation cost burden.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the low income levels, prioritized proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden to maintain affordability 2) Selected options that improve transit service times to benefit transit-dependent residents 3) Considered moderate driving fees to fund transit improvements while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced the need for system improvements with the community's limited ability to pay additional taxes 5) Favored proposals that reduce transit travel times below 55 minutes to make transit more competitive"
