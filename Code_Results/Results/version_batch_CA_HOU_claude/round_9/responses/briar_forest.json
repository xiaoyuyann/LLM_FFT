    "disposable_income": "Briar Forest residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income around $75,000, indicating capacity to absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has significant discretionary spending power with many retail centers and restaurants, suggesting residents can manage higher sales taxes without severe impact on quality of life.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood is car-dependent with limited transit options, longer transit travel times, and high car ownership rates, making driving the dominant mode of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) since residents make significant retail purchases. 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without severely impacting the car-dependent population. 3) Supported lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage occasional transit use. 4) Selected policies that achieve meaningful travel time improvements while balancing cost impacts. 5) Considered the area's high car dependency while maintaining support for transit improvements."
