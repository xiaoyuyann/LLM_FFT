    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor/Port Houston is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 30% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has some bus service but limited rail access, with many residents dependent on public transit, while others rely on personal vehicles for work commutes to industrial areas and the port.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited household incomes 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening working drivers 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit service improvements while minimizing financial burden on low-income residents"
