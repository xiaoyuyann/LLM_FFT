  "thinking": {
    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents working in service and industrial jobs along the Gulf Freeway corridor.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity with most income going to basic necessities, making residents particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has decent bus service along major corridors and is served by the Southeast Transit Center, but many residents rely on personal vehicles for work commutes to dispersed job locations.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents while keeping sales tax moderate at 1% to balance revenue needs and household burden. 2) Selected proposals with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent workers. 3) Avoided highest tax/fee combinations due to limited household budgets. 4) Favored proposals showing good improvements in transit travel times. 5) Considered both transit and driving needs given mixed transportation patterns in the area."
