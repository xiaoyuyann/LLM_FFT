    "disposable_income": "Jensen is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $27,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, with most income dedicated to essential needs like housing and food, making them highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed job locations and limited frequent transit service.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower combined costs (tax + fare/fee) due to limited household incomes. 2. Favored proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to make transit more accessible. 3. Preferred moderate driving fees ($0.50) over high fees ($1.00) to avoid excessive burden on car-dependent residents. 4. Selected lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases. 5. Balanced improved transit times with cost considerations, recognizing both transit and car users' needs."
