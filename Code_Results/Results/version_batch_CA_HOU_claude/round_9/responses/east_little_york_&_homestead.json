    "disposable_income": "The median household income in East Little York / Homestead is relatively low at around $35,000, with many residents living on fixed or limited incomes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending capacity, with a significant portion of income going to basic necessities like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to longer transit travel times and dispersed destinations for work and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income residents who depend on transit. 2) Favored moderate tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to balance service improvements with household budget impacts. 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4) Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 57 minutes. 5) Considered combined cost burden of taxes, fares, and fees on limited household budgets."
