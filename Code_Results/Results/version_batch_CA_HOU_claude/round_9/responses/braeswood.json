    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good car accessibility with proximity to major thoroughfares and moderate transit access through METRO bus routes, though most residents are car-dependent for daily trips.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car ownership and usage, prioritized proposals that reduce car travel time while keeping driving fees moderate 2) Higher income means residents can tolerate some tax increase if it improves service 3) Selected proposals with balanced fare structures since transit is a secondary mode 4) Focused on options that provide meaningful travel time improvements for both modes 5) Considered that higher sales tax impact is moderate given area's spending patterns"
