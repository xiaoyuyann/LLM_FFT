    "disposable_income": "Clinton Park / Tri-Community is a lower-income neighborhood with median household income around $25,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate and limited disposable income, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit service despite relatively low car ownership rates, with many residents relying on public transportation for essential trips.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-owning residents. 4) Selected proposals that achieve reasonable transit time improvements while keeping costs manageable. 5) Balanced the need for transit system improvements with the community's limited ability to absorb additional costs."
