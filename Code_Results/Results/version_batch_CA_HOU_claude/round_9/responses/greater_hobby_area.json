    "disposable_income": "The Greater Hobby Area has a median household income of approximately $45,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower-than-average income levels and higher poverty rates, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to sales tax increases.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the area's relatively suburban character and proximity to Hobby Airport employment.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares and moderate taxes to help transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality 2) Considered moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers 3) Balanced travel time improvements against cost impacts 4) Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to around 55-56 minutes 5) Avoided highest tax rates that would disproportionately impact low-income residents"
