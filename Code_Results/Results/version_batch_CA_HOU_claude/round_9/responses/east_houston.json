    "disposable_income": "East Houston has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents living paycheck to paycheck and sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity with most income going to basic necessities, making residents particularly vulnerable to increased taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit coverage but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed job locations and limited frequent bus service.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares and taxes given limited disposable income 2) Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 3) Sought balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts 4) Favored proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 57 minutes 5) Considered that many residents make multiple trips per day, amplifying fare/fee impacts 6) Selected proposals that maintain reasonable driving access while incrementally improving transit"
