    "disposable_income": "Greater Inwood has a median household income of around $45,000, which is lower than Houston's average, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and higher poverty rates than city average, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to both sales tax and transit fares.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but is largely car-dependent, with about 80% of residents commuting by car and facing significant travel times to employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents while keeping sales tax moderate. 2) Selected policies with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, favoring options that reduce transit travel times below 57 minutes. 4) Considered the community's limited discretionary income when evaluating sales tax impacts. 5) Chose options that provide meaningful travel time improvements while minimizing total cost burden on residents."
