    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but high car dependency, with about 85% of residents commuting by car and experiencing significant traffic congestion during peak hours.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies that balance lower transit fares and moderate sales tax to support transit improvements while keeping costs manageable for working-class residents. 2) Considered moderate driving fees to reduce congestion while not overly burdening car-dependent commuters. 3) Selected proposals that offer meaningful transit time improvements without excessive cost burden. 4) Favored options that provide the best transit time reductions while maintaining affordability. 5) Balanced the need for transit funding through sales tax with household budget constraints."
