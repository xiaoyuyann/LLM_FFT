    "disposable_income": "Park Place has a median household income of approximately $38,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of working-class families and a cost-burdened housing situation, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the need to access jobs in various parts of Houston, with about 75% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the low income levels, prioritized proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden to protect household budgets. 2) Selected options that balance driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3) Focused on proposals that offer meaningful travel time improvements for both transit and car users. 4) Considered the community's need for reliable and affordable transportation options given the high proportion of working-class residents. 5) Weighted the tradeoff between tax burden and service improvements to maximize benefit for cost-sensitive residents."
