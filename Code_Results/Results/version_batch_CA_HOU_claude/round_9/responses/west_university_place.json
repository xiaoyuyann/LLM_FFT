    "disposable_income": "West University Place residents have high disposable incomes with a median household income over $250,000, making them less sensitive to transit fares and driving fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has very high discretionary spending capacity with significant retail expenditure and luxury consumption patterns, so sales tax impact is relatively minor.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent road access, high car ownership rates, and limited transit dependency, though it benefits from proximity to major employment centers and the Texas Medical Center.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost sensitivity 2) Support policies that reduce congestion and travel times 3) Higher driver fees acceptable given income levels and desire to reduce traffic 4) Moderate transit fares to maintain service quality while not overly subsidizing 5) Balance tax rates to fund improvements without excessive burden 6) Selected policies that maximize car travel time reductions while maintaining reasonable transit options"
