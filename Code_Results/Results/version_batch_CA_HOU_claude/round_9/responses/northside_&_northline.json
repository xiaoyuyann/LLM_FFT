    "disposable_income": "Northside/Northline is a working-class neighborhood with median household income around $36,000, significantly below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower income levels and higher poverty rates, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good METRO bus service and light rail access along North Main, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed employment locations and limited transit coverage in some parts.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with tax burden 3) Selected moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers 4) Considered travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transit/car usage 5) Balanced revenue generation for transit improvements with community's limited ability to pay additional costs"
