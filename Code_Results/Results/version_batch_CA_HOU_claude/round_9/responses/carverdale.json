    "disposable_income": "Carverdale has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels and high proportion of essential expenses, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit access with infrequent bus service, high car dependency for work commutes to industrial areas, and relatively long travel times to major employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more affordable for transit-dependent residents. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent workers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, recognizing both transit users and drivers in the community. 5. Selected proposals that offer the best combination of reduced travel times while keeping overall costs manageable for low-income residents."
