    "disposable_income": "Lazybrook/Timbergrove is an upper-middle-income neighborhood with median household income around $100,000, indicating relatively high disposable income and ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power with high rates of home ownership and retail consumption, suggesting they can manage moderate increases in transportation costs without major lifestyle impacts.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good car accessibility with quick access to I-610 and I-10, moderate bus service along key corridors, but no direct rail access, making most residents car-dependent for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency but also ability to afford fees, prioritized proposals with moderate driving fees to reduce congestion while keeping transit affordable 2) Selected moderate tax rates that can fund transit improvements without excessive burden 3) Favored proposals that achieve significant travel time reductions for both modes 4) Balanced driving fees with lower transit fares to encourage occasional transit use 5) Considered that higher-income residents can absorb some cost increases if it improves overall system efficiency"
