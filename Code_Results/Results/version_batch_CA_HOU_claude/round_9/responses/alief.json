    "disposable_income": "Alief has a median household income of around $46,000, which is lower than Houston's average, with approximately 18% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels and high proportion of working-class families, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Alief is heavily car-dependent with limited public transit options, though it has some bus routes connecting to major employment centers, and about 15% of households don't own vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents and encourage transit use. 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with tax burden on low-income residents. 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to fund transit while not overly burdening car-dependent workers. 4) Selected proposals that achieve meaningful transit time improvements while keeping costs affordable. 5) Considered the high proportion of working-class residents who are sensitive to both time and cost."
