    "disposable_income": "Hidden Valley residents have moderate to low disposable income with a median household income around $45,000, indicating sensitivity to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity means residents are price-sensitive to both transit fares and driving fees, with most household budgets primarily allocated to essential needs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with bus routes but relies heavily on personal vehicles, with about 85% of residents commuting by car due to limited transit coverage.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency but modest incomes, prioritized policies with lower driving fees and moderate taxes to avoid overburdening drivers. 2) Selected proposals with lower transit fares to encourage transit use while keeping it affordable. 3) Balanced travel time improvements against cost impacts, favoring options that reduce car travel times without excessive fees. 4) Considered the 0.5-1.0% tax range as most sustainable for the community's income level. 5) Prioritized proposals that offer meaningful travel time improvements while minimizing financial burden on residents."
