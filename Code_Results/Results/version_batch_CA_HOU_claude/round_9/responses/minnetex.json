    "disposable_income": "Minnetex has relatively low median household income with many residents living below poverty level, making them particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity due to lower income levels and high basic living expenses in this working-class neighborhood.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited transit service coverage but high car dependency, with many residents relying on personal vehicles for work commutes and daily needs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited disposable income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more accessible. 3. Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost considerations. 5. Selected proposals that provide best combined benefits for both transit users and drivers given community constraints."
