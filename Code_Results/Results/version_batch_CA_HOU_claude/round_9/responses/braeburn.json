    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate car dependency with limited transit options, though it's served by some METRO bus routes and is relatively close to the Southwest Freeway.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5%) to protect limited disposable income 2) Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that offer the best combination of reduced transit travel times while keeping overall costs manageable for residents"
