    "disposable_income": "South Acres/Crestmont Park is a lower-middle income community with median household income around $35,000-40,000, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",

    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with some bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being higher than city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that provide best accessibility improvements while minimizing financial burden on low-income residents"
