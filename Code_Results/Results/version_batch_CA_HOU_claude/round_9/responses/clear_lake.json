    "disposable_income": "Clear Lake residents have relatively high disposable income with median household income around $80,000, significantly above Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area shows strong discretionary spending capacity with high rates of retail activity and numerous shopping centers, suggesting residents can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "accessibility": "Clear Lake is a car-dependent suburban area with limited transit options, longer distances to downtown, and high car ownership rates, though some residents use park-and-ride services for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) since residents make significant retail purchases 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without severely impacting car-dependent lifestyle 3) Supported moderate transit fares ($1.25) to balance service quality with accessibility 4) Selected proposals that achieve meaningful travel time reductions for both modes 5) Considered the suburban nature and higher income levels that make the community more tolerant of driving costs than transit fares"
