    "disposable_income": "Central Northwest has a moderate median household income around $45,000, with about 25% of residents living below poverty level, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the income levels and cost of living, residents have modest discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has decent bus service along major corridors but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of commuters driving alone and 15% using transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality. 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance revenue needs with household budget impacts. 3) Supported modest driving fees ($0.50) to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transit/driving usage. 5) Ranked proposals that offer best combined benefits in reduced travel times while keeping costs manageable for lower-income residents."
