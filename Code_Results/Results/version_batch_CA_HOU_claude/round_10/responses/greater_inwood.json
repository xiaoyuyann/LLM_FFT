    "disposable_income": "Greater Inwood has a median household income of approximately $45,000, which is lower than Houston's average, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and higher poverty rates than city average, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to both transit fares and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but is largely car-dependent, with about 80% of residents commuting by car and facing significant travel times to employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares and sales tax due to limited disposable income, 2) Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents, 3) Balanced travel time improvements against cost impacts, 4) Selected policies that reduce transit travel times to under 57 minutes while keeping combined costs manageable, 5) Considered that many residents need both car and transit access due to work patterns"
