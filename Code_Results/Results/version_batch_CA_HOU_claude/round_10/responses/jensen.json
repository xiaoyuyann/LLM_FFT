    "disposable_income": "Jensen is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $31,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, with a high percentage of income going to basic necessities like housing and food.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to job locations and schedule needs, with about 75% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given low incomes, prioritized lower transit fares and sales tax to preserve disposable income. 2) Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3) Balanced travel time improvements against cost impacts. 4) Selected policies that reduce transit travel times to under 57 minutes to make transit more viable. 5) Avoided highest tax/fee combinations that would strain household budgets."
