    "disposable_income": "Pleasantville Area has a median household income of around $35,000, which is lower than Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and high cost of living, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent bus service but limited rail access, with many residents relying on both public transit and personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income transit-dependent residents. 2. Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance transit funding with household budget impacts. 3. Selected proposals with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4. Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users. 5. Balanced overall household cost impact from combined taxes and fees."
