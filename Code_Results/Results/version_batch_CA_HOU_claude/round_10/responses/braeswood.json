    "disposable_income": "Braeswood is an affluent area with median household income above $100,000, indicating residents have substantial disposable income and can generally afford higher transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power and typically engage in high levels of retail and service consumption, making them somewhat less sensitive to sales tax increases.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good road access via Loop 610 and Braeswood Boulevard, with moderate transit service through METRO buses, and most households own multiple vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car ownership and income levels, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve transit; 2) Higher sales tax is less burdensome given high discretionary spending; 3) Moderate transit fares are preferred to support service quality while keeping transit competitive; 4) Prioritized policies that reduce car travel times since driving is dominant mode; 5) Selected balanced proposals that improve both transit and driving conditions without extreme costs in any category."
