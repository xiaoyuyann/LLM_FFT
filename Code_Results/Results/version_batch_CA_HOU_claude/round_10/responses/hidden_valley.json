    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access but high car dependency, with about 85% of residents commuting by car and facing significant travel times to reach employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency and limited income, prioritized proposals with lower driving fees and taxes to minimize financial burden. 2) Selected proposals that offer reasonable transit improvements without excessive costs. 3) Balanced travel time improvements against increased fees. 4) Considered that lower transit fares could provide alternative options for cost-sensitive residents. 5) Prioritized proposals that maintain reasonable car travel times given the community's reliance on driving."
