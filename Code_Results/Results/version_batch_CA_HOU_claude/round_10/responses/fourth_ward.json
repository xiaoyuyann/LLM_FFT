    "disposable_income": "Fourth Ward residents have relatively low disposable income with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high housing costs consuming a large portion of income and 30% poverty rate, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to additional fees and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good transit access being close to downtown with multiple bus routes, but also has relatively high car dependency with 70% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income residents who rely on transit. 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance transit funding needs with residents' limited disposable income. 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent commuters. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users given mixed transportation needs. 5) Selected proposals that minimize total cost burden while maximizing service improvements."
