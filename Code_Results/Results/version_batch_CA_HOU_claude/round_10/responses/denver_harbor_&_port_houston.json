    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor/Port Houston is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",

    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has some bus service but limited rail access, with many residents relying on personal vehicles despite the financial burden, and about 15% of households don't own vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent workers 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit service improvements while minimizing total cost impact on low-income residents"
