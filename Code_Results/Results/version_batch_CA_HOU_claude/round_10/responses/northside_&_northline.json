    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good METRO bus service and Red Line light rail access, but still has significant car dependency with about 75% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with tax burden 3) Selected moderate driving fees ($0.50) to encourage transit use while not overly burdening car-dependent workers 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users 5) Ranked proposals that provide best combined benefits for mixed-mode community while protecting limited household budgets"
