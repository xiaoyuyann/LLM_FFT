    "disposable_income": "Meyerland is an affluent neighborhood with median household income above $100,000, indicating relatively high disposable income and ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power with high retail activity along major corridors and shopping centers, suggesting less sensitivity to sales tax increases.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good road access via Loop 610 and Beechnut Street, with METRO bus service but no rail, and most residents are car-dependent with high vehicle ownership rates.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency but desire for better transit, prioritized proposals with moderate driving fees to fund transit improvements while keeping sales tax moderate 2) Selected proposals that balance travel time improvements for both modes 3) Chose moderate to higher transit fares since residents can afford them and it helps fund better service 4) Avoided highest sales tax options since it affects all purchases 5) Preferred proposals that showed significant transit time improvements to make it a more viable option"
