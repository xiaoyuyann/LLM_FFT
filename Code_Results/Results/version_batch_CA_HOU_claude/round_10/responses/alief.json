    "disposable_income": "Alief has a median household income of around $46,000, which is below Houston's median, with approximately 18% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels and high proportion of working-class families, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "Alief is heavily car-dependent with limited public transit options, though about 15% of households don't own vehicles and rely on transit, making both driving and transit improvements important.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality. 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance revenue needs with household budget impacts. 3) Selected moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both modes given mixed transportation needs. 5) Aimed to minimize overall cost burden while maximizing service improvements for this working-class community."
