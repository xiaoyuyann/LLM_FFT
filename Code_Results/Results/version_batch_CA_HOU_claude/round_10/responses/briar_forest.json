    "disposable_income": "Briar Forest residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income around $75,000, indicating capacity to absorb moderate transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has significant discretionary spending power with many retail centers and restaurants, suggesting residents can manage higher sales taxes without severe impact on quality of life.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood is car-dependent with limited transit options, longer transit travel times, and high car ownership rates, making driving the dominant mode of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) since residents make significant retail purchases. 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without severely impacting the car-dependent population. 3) Supported lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage occasional transit use. 4) Selected policies that achieve good balance between car travel time reduction and transit improvement. 5) Considered the area's higher income levels that can absorb some cost increases for better overall transportation system."
