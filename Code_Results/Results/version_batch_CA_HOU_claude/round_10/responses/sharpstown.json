    "disposable_income": "Sharpstown has a median household income of approximately $38,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of residents being lower-middle income, discretionary spending is constrained and residents are sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good automobile access via Southwest Freeway and Beltway 8, moderate bus service, but limited rail transit access, with about 75% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income, 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents, 3) Selected lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable for those who depend on it, 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, considering the area's car-dependency and income constraints, 5) Considered policies that provide meaningful transit improvements without excessive financial burden on residents."
