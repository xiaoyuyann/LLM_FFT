    "disposable_income": "Greater Greenspoint has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents living below the poverty line and facing significant financial constraints.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending capacity, with a high proportion of income going to essential needs like housing and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit service but high car dependency, with about 75% of residents commuting by car and facing significant transportation costs relative to their income.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low incomes, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers. 4. Balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Consider proposals that reduce both transit and driving times while keeping combined costs manageable for low-income residents."
