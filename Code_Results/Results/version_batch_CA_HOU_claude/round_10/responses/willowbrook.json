    "disposable_income": "Willowbrook residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income above Houston's average, as it is predominantly a middle to upper-middle-class suburban area.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has significant discretionary spending capacity with numerous retail centers and shopping destinations, including Willowbrook Mall, suggesting residents can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with limited public transit options, primarily served by park-and-ride facilities and bus routes, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for daily commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the car-dependent nature and higher income levels, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve transit service 2) Lower sales tax rates are preferred since residents make significant retail purchases 3) Transit fares are less critical since fewer residents rely on transit 4) Prioritized policies that balance driving time improvements with moderate cost increases 5) Selected proposals that could gradually encourage transit use while not severely impacting driving costs"
