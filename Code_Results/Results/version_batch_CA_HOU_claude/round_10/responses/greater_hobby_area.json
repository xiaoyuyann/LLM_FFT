    "disposable_income": "The Greater Hobby Area has a median household income of approximately $45,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower-than-average household incomes, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to sales tax increases and transportation fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the area's proximity to Hobby Airport and industrial employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares and moderate taxes to help transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality. 2) Selected policies with moderate driving fees to reduce congestion but not overly burden car-dependent workers. 3) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, considering the area's working-class demographics. 4) Favored proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve access to jobs. 5) Considered the combined impact of sales tax and transportation costs on household budgets."
