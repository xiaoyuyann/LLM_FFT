    "disposable_income": "Greater Uptown residents have relatively high disposable incomes with a median household income well above Houston's average, indicating greater ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has high discretionary spending power with numerous luxury retail establishments and high-end restaurants, suggesting residents can manage higher transportation costs without significant lifestyle impacts.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good road infrastructure with proximity to major highways, moderate transit access via METRO buses, and high car ownership rates, though it experiences significant traffic congestion during peak hours.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies that reduce car travel times given the area's congestion issues and residents' high value of time. 2) Higher income levels mean residents can tolerate higher driving fees if they deliver better traffic flow. 3) Selected moderate to higher tax rates to fund transit improvements while balancing impact on discretionary spending. 4) Favored policies that provide good transit options for service workers while maintaining reasonable fares. 5) Considered the area's mixed-use nature requiring both efficient car and transit access."
