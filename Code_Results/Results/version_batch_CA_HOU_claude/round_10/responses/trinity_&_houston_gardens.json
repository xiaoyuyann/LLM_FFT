    "disposable_income": "Trinity/Houston Gardens is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity, with a high percentage of income dedicated to essential needs like housing and utilities, making them particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit coverage with longer walking distances to bus stops, and while car ownership is necessary for many residents, maintaining a vehicle represents a significant financial burden.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more accessible for low-income residents. 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5%-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases. 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) as a compromise to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4) Selected proposals that achieve reasonable transit time improvements without excessive cost burden. 5) Balanced the need for system improvements with the community's limited ability to absorb additional costs."
