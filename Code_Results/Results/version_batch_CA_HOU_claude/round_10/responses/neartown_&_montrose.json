    "disposable_income": "Neartown-Montrose residents have relatively high disposable incomes with median household income around $87,000, significantly above Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has high discretionary spending capacity, with residents frequently patronizing local restaurants, bars, retail shops, and entertainment venues in this culturally vibrant area.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good walkability, decent transit access with multiple bus routes, and relatively short driving distances to major employment centers, though many residents rely on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the higher income levels, residents can absorb moderate tax/fee increases if they improve service 2) Many residents both drive and occasionally use transit, so balanced improvements to both modes are valued 3) The area's mixed-use character means both transit and driving need to work well 4) Proposals that significantly reduce travel times while keeping costs moderate are preferred 5) Lower transit fares are less critical given income levels, but moderate fees/taxes that improve service are acceptable"
