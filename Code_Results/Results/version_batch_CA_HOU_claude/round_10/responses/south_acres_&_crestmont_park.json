    "disposable_income": "South Acres/Crestmont Park is a lower-middle income community with median household income around $35,000-40,000, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have relatively low discretionary spending power, making them particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit service with longer travel times, and while car ownership is common, many residents are transit-dependent and face significant transportation cost burdens.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driver fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers 4) Selected policies that provide meaningful travel time improvements while keeping costs manageable 5) Balanced need for transit service improvements with community's limited ability to absorb additional costs"
