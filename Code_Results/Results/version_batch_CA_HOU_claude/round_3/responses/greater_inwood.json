    "disposable_income": "Greater Inwood has a median household income of around $45,000, which is lower than Houston's average, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and higher poverty rates than city average, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to both transit fares and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but is largely car-dependent, with about 80% of residents commuting by car and facing significant travel times to employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares and moderate sales tax to help lower-income residents while maintaining service quality. 2) Favored options with moderate driving fees to reduce congestion while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3) Selected proposals that balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 4) Considered that many residents make multiple trips per day and are sensitive to per-trip costs. 5) Aimed to maintain transit service quality while keeping overall costs manageable for working families."
