    "disposable_income": "Greater Fifth Ward has a median household income of approximately $27,000, significantly below Houston's average, with about 40% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, with most income dedicated to essential needs like housing, utilities, and basic necessities.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has relatively high transit dependency with lower car ownership rates, multiple bus routes serving the area, and proximity to light rail, though many residents still face transportation challenges.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritized proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden. 2. Selected options that improve transit service times to benefit transit-dependent population. 3. Supported moderate driving fees to fund transit improvements while not overly burdening car-owning residents. 4. Balanced need for transit funding through sales tax with community's limited purchasing power. 5. Considered proposals that reduce both transit and driving times to benefit all residents."
