    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good road access via Westheimer Road and Beltway 8, moderate bus service, but limited rail transit access, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending 2) Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that offer meaningful transit improvements while minimizing financial burden on mixed-income population"
