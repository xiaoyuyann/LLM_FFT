    "disposable_income": "Edgebrook has a median household income of around $45,000, which is lower than Houston's average, indicating residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and significant portion going to basic needs, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to both sales tax increases and transportation fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but is largely car-dependent, with about 90% of residents commuting by car and facing significant travel times to employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to protect discretionary spending power, 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) over high fees ($1.00) given car dependency, 3) Preferred lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to make transit more accessible, 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, 5) Selected proposals that provide reasonable transit service improvements without excessive financial burden on residents."
