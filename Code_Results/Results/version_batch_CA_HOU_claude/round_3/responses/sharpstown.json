    "disposable_income": "Sharpstown has a median household income of approximately $38,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of residents being lower-middle income, discretionary spending is constrained and residents are sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate car dependency with some bus service, approximately 20% of households don't own vehicles, and the neighborhood has direct access to multiple METRO bus routes but limited rail access.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality. 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance revenue needs with household budget impacts. 3) Selected proposals with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to encourage transit use without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users. 5) Focused on options that provide good transit service while minimizing impact on limited household budgets."
