    "disposable_income": "Afton Oaks/River Oaks is one of Houston's most affluent neighborhoods with very high median household incomes well above $200,000, indicating high disposable income and lower sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power and typically engage in high-end retail, dining, and services, with transportation costs representing a small portion of their overall budget.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent road infrastructure, high car ownership rates, and while transit service exists, most residents rely primarily on personal vehicles for transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high incomes, prioritize time savings over cost considerations 2) Support policies that reduce traffic congestion through higher driving fees 3) Higher tax rates acceptable if they improve overall system efficiency 4) Prefer proposals that significantly reduce car travel times 5) Transit improvements are secondary but supported for workforce access 6) Selected proposals 23, 20, 17, 14, and 11 as they offer the best car travel time reductions through combined higher taxes and driving fees, while the increased costs are negligible for this affluent area"
