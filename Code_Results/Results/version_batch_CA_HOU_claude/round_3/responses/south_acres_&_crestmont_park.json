    "disposable_income": "South Acres/Crestmont Park is a lower-middle income community with median household income around $35,000-40,000, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have relatively low discretionary spending power, making them particularly sensitive to increases in transportation costs and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being higher than city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given limited disposable income, prioritized lower transit fares and sales tax rates to minimize financial burden. 2) Selected policies that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility for transit-dependent residents. 3) Moderate driving fees acceptable to fund transit improvements while not overly burdening drivers. 4) Balanced need for transit service improvements with community's ability to pay. 5) Favored proposals that reduce both transit and driving times while keeping combined costs manageable."
