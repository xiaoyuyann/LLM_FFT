    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood's residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity, with significant portions going to housing, transportation, and education expenses given the proximity to universities and medical centers.",
    "accessibility": "MacGregor has good accessibility with multiple bus routes, proximity to light rail, major highways, and is close to Texas Medical Center, universities, and Hermann Park, though many residents rely on personal vehicles.",
