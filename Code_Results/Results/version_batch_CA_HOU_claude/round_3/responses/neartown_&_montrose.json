    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high income levels, residents can absorb moderate tax/fee increases if they improve service quality 2) Many residents both drive and use transit, so balanced improvements to both modes are valuable 3) The area's mixed-use character means both transit and driving need to work well 4) Proposals with moderate taxes (1%) and balanced fee structures provide best overall mobility improvements 5) Lower transit fares encourage transit use while moderate driving fees help manage congestion 6) Selected proposals reduce transit travel times by 5-7 minutes while keeping driving times reasonable"
