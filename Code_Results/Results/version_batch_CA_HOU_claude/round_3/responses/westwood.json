    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but high car dependency, with about 75% of residents commuting by car and experiencing significant transportation cost burden.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected policies that provide the best accessibility improvements for the lowest combined cost burden"
