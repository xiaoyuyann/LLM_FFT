    "disposable_income": "Addicks / Park Ten residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income above $100,000, indicating greater ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area's affluent population has significant discretionary spending capacity and tends to prioritize convenience and time savings over cost savings.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with limited transit access, featuring major employment centers and retail along I-10 corridor where most residents rely on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency and income levels, policies that reduce car travel time are priority 2) Higher sales tax is acceptable given disposable income and potential service improvements 3) Moderate driving fees can help fund transit without excessive burden 4) Lower transit fares less critical since fewer residents rely on transit 5) Selected policies balance car travel time reduction with reasonable fee increases that the community can afford"
