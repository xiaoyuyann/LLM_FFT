    "disposable_income": "Fort Bend Houston has relatively high median household income around $75,000, with many professional workers and homeowners who have significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity, with many households able to afford personal vehicles and regular retail/entertainment expenses.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit access, though some bus routes connect to major employment centers and the broader Houston metro area.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) since residents have high consumption levels and would be disproportionately impacted by higher taxes. 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3) Supported lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage transit use as an alternative. 4) Selected policies that achieve meaningful travel time improvements for both modes. 5) Balanced revenue generation for transit improvements with household cost burden."
