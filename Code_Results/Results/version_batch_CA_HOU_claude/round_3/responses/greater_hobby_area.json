    "disposable_income": "The Greater Hobby Area has a median household income of approximately $45,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower-than-average income levels and a significant portion of the population working in service industries, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to both transit fares and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the area's proximity to Hobby Airport and industrial employment centers, with current transit times being significantly longer than driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares and moderate taxes to help cost-burdened residents 2) Considered moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers 3) Sought balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts 4) Favored proposals that reduce transit travel times to support transit-dependent residents 5) Selected options that minimize overall financial burden while maintaining service quality"
