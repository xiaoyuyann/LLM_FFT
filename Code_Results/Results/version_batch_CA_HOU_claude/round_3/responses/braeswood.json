    "disposable_income": "Braeswood is an upper-middle-income neighborhood with median household income around $100,000, indicating relatively high disposable income and ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending capacity with high rates of retail and restaurant patronage, suggesting they can manage moderate increases in transportation costs without major lifestyle impacts.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good car accessibility to major employment centers and retail areas, with moderate transit access via METRO bus routes and relatively close proximity to the Texas Medical Center.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car ownership and usage, policies that reduce car travel times while maintaining reasonable driving costs are preferred. 2) Higher sales tax is acceptable given income levels if it improves overall transportation system. 3) Moderate transit fares balanced with driving fees help fund improvements while encouraging some mode shift. 4) Travel time savings are prioritized over small cost increases. 5) Selected policies that provide good transit service for workers accessing the neighborhood while maintaining efficient car travel."
