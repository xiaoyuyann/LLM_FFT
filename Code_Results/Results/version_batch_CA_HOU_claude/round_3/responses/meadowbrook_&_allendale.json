    "disposable_income": "Meadowbrook/Allendale is a working-class neighborhood with median household income around $45,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have modest discretionary spending capacity, with many households being cost-sensitive to transportation expenses and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being significant factor in transportation choices.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on household budgets, 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable for working families, 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers, 4) Sought balance between reduced travel times and cost increases, 5) Considered that many residents make both transit and car trips, so policies should not extremely disadvantage either mode"
