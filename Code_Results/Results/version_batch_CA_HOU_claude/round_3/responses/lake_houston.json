    "disposable_income": "Lake Houston residents have relatively high median household incomes around $90,000, with most households having significant disposable income for transportation and other expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area's residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity, with many families able to afford private vehicles and regular shopping/entertainment activities.",
    "accessibility": "Lake Houston is a suburban area heavily dependent on private vehicles, with limited public transit options and longer distances to major employment and activity centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the car-dependent nature of Lake Houston and higher incomes, policies with lower driving fees are prioritized 2) Lower sales tax rates are preferred since residents make significant retail purchases 3) Higher transit fares are acceptable since transit usage is low 4) Policies that reduce driving times are valued but not at the expense of much higher driving costs 5) Selected proposals balance maintaining reasonable driving costs while funding some transit improvements through moderate fees and fares"
