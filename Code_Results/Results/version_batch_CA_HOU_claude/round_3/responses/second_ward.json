    "disposable_income": "Second Ward has a lower median household income around $31,000, with approximately 35% of residents living below the poverty line, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels and high poverty rate, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to increases in transit fares, driving fees, and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good access to METRO bus routes and light rail, with about 25% of residents relying on public transit, while many others depend on personal vehicles for work commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to support transit-dependent residents, 2) Favored moderate sales tax (1%) to balance transit funding with household budget impacts, 3) Considered driving fees to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent workers, 4) Selected options that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility for working residents, 5) Balanced overall cost burden across different transportation modes given the neighborhood's economic constraints."
