    "disposable_income": "Carverdale has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels and high proportion of essential expenses, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit coverage despite being a working-class neighborhood, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting to jobs in nearby industrial areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more affordable for cost-sensitive residents 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Ranked options that provided meaningful transit time improvements without excessive cost burden 5) Considered balance between car and transit improvements given mixed transportation needs of working population"
