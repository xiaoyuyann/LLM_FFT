    "accessibility": "The area has good road access via I-10 and Memorial Drive, decent bus service, and is relatively close to downtown, though many residents are car-dependent despite some walkable sections along Washington Ave.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high incomes, prioritized policies that optimize travel times over cost savings 2) Selected moderate-to-high tax rates to fund transit improvements since residents can afford it 3) Supported higher driving fees to reduce congestion on major corridors 4) Balanced transit fares to maintain service quality while keeping transit competitive 5) Considered that many residents will continue driving despite fees, so emphasized policies that significantly improve travel times for both modes"
