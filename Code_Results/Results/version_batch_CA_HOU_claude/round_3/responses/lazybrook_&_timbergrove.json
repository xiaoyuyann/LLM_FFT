    "disposable_income": "Lazybrook/Timbergrove is an upper-middle-income neighborhood with median household income around $100,000, indicating relatively high disposable income and ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power and tend to prioritize quality of life amenities, with many households able to afford multiple vehicles and regular retail/dining expenses.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good car accessibility to major roads like 610 Loop and I-10, moderate bus service, and is relatively close to downtown, though most residents are car-dependent for daily trips.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car ownership and income levels, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve transit; 2) Higher sales tax is less impactful due to high disposable income; 3) Moderate transit fares balance system funding with accessibility; 4) Prioritized options that reduce car travel times since most residents drive; 5) Selected policies that provide best overall time savings while maintaining reasonable costs."
