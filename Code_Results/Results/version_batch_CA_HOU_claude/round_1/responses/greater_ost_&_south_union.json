    "disposable_income": "The Greater OST / South Union area has a median household income of approximately $35,000, which is significantly below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households below the poverty line and significant housing cost burden, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of households having access to a car while facing relatively long commute times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households 4) Selected policies that achieve meaningful travel time improvements while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents 5) Balanced the need for transit system improvements with the community's limited ability to absorb additional costs"
