    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited public transit options, with many residents dependent on personal vehicles despite the financial burden, while bus service is available but with longer travel times and limited coverage.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income transit users 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Selected policies that offer meaningful travel time improvements for both transit and car users 5) Balanced the need for transit system improvements with the community's limited ability to absorb additional costs"
