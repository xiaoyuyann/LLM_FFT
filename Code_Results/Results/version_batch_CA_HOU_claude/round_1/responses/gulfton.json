    "disposable_income": "Gulfton residents have relatively low disposable income with a median household income around $31,000, significantly below Houston's average, and about 35% of residents live below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high poverty rates and large immigrant population, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, making them highly sensitive to transportation costs and sales tax increases.",
    "accessibility": "Gulfton is heavily transit-dependent with lower car ownership rates than Houston average, has high population density, and relies significantly on METRO bus services for access to jobs and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-owning residents 4) Selected options that provide good balance of reduced transit travel times while keeping costs manageable 5) Considered high transit usage rates in the neighborhood when weighing benefits of improved service versus costs"
