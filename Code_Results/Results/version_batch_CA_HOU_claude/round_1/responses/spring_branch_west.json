    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch West has a median household income of around $55,000, placing it in the middle-income range for Houston, with approximately 15% of residents below poverty level.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity but are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees, with significant portions of income already going to housing and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit options, featuring some bus routes but no direct rail access, and about 85% of residents commute by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the car-dependent nature and middle-income status, prioritized policies with lower driving fees and moderate taxes to avoid excessive burden on drivers. 2) Selected proposals that balance transit improvements with cost considerations, as many residents rely on cars but could benefit from improved transit options. 3) Favored policies that offer meaningful transit time improvements without extreme cost increases. 4) Considered the impact of sales tax on overall household budgets, preferring moderate rates. 5) Prioritized proposals that provide the best value in terms of reduced travel times relative to cost increases."
