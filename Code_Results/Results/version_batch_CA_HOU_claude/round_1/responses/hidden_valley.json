    "disposable_income": "Hidden Valley residents have moderate to low disposable income with a median household income around $45,000, indicating sensitivity to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity means residents are price-sensitive to both transit fares and driving fees, with most household budgets primarily allocated to essential needs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with bus routes but relies heavily on personal vehicles, with about 85% of residents commuting by car due to limited transit options and longer transit travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) over high fees ($1.00) to balance revenue generation with affordability. 3) Preferred lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to maintain transit accessibility for transit-dependent residents. 4) Selected policies that achieve reasonable travel time improvements without excessive cost burden. 5) Considered the high car dependency while maintaining affordable transit options."
