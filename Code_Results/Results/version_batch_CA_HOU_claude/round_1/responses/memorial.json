    "disposable_income": "Memorial is one of Houston's most affluent areas with median household income over $140,000, indicating high disposable income and less sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power with high-end retail centers and shopping destinations, suggesting higher consumption patterns and ability to absorb increased taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit access, featuring good road infrastructure including I-10 and Memorial Drive, while most residents rely on personal vehicles for transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency and income levels, policies with lower driving fees are preferred. 2) Higher sales tax is acceptable due to high discretionary spending power. 3) Transit improvements are less critical due to low transit usage. 4) Focus on maintaining efficient car travel times. 5) Selected policies balance maintaining car accessibility while providing moderate transit improvements through sales tax rather than driving fees."
