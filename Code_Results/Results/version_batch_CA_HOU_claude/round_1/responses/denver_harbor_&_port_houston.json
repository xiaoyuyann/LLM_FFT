    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor/Port Houston is a working-class neighborhood with median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of residents living below poverty level (around 30%), discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has some bus service but limited transit infrastructure overall, with many residents relying on personal vehicles despite the financial burden, and average commute times being higher than city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more accessible for low-income residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) that could improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Selected proposals that offered meaningful reductions in transit travel times 5) Balanced the need for improved transit service with the community's limited ability to pay higher taxes and fees"
