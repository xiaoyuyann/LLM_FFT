    "disposable_income": "Fort Bend Houston has relatively high median household income around $75,000, with many middle to upper-middle class professionals who have significant disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity and tend to prioritize quality of life investments, with many households able to absorb moderate increases in transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area is car-dependent with good road access but limited transit options, though there is growing interest in improved public transportation connections to major employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies that balance moderate tax increases with improved transit service while keeping driving costs manageable given car-dependency. 2) Selected options that reduce transit travel times to increase viability as an alternative mode. 3) Favored proposals with moderate driver fees to fund improvements while not overly burdening drivers. 4) Considered the community's ability to absorb higher taxes given income levels. 5) Ranked proposals that could lead to meaningful transit improvements while maintaining reasonable costs for both transit users and drivers."
