    "disposable_income": "Addicks / Park Ten residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income above $100,000, indicating greater ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area's affluent population has significant discretionary spending capacity and tends to prioritize convenience and time savings over minor cost differences.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with limited transit access, featuring major highways (I-10, Beltway 8) and business parks where most residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the car-dependent nature and high income levels, policies that reduce car travel times while maintaining reasonable driving costs are prioritized. 2) Higher sales tax rates are acceptable given the area's affluence and potential for improved transit infrastructure. 3) Moderate driving fees are preferred to reduce congestion while not overly burdening necessary car travel. 4) Lower transit fares are less critical given the limited transit usage and higher incomes. 5) Selected policies balance travel time improvements with moderate cost increases that the community can afford."
