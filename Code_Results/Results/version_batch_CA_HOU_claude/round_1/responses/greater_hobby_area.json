    "disposable_income": "The Greater Hobby Area has a median household income of approximately $45,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower-than-average income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly affected by additional taxes and fees on daily expenses.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the area's proximity to Hobby Airport and industrial employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents while keeping sales tax moderate (1%) to balance revenue needs. 2) Selected policies with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion without overly burdening car-dependent workers. 3) Focused on options that provide meaningful transit time improvements while maintaining affordability. 4) Considered the area's mixed transit-driving usage patterns and need to serve both airport workers and residential commuters. 5) Balanced the need for system improvements with residents' limited ability to absorb additional costs."
