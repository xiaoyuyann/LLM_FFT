    "disposable_income": "Alief has a median household income of around $46,000, which is below Houston's median, with approximately 19% of residents living below the poverty line, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower-than-average income levels and high percentage of working-class families, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "Alief is heavily car-dependent with limited public transit options, though it has some bus services, and many residents rely on personal vehicles for their daily commute to work and accessing services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with tax burden 3) Selected policies with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users 5) Focused on options that minimize overall cost impact while maximizing service improvements"
