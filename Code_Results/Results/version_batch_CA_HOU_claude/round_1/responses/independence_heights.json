    "disposable_income": "Independence Heights has a relatively low median household income of around $33,000, with approximately 30% of residents living below the poverty line, making them particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and must carefully balance essential needs with transportation expenses.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 70% of households owning cars despite the financial burden.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden. 2. Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3. Balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts. 4. Selected proposals 6, 0, 7, 15, and 2 as they offer reasonable compromises between transit affordability ($0.75-$1.25 fares), moderate tax impacts (0.5-1.0%), and improved transit service without excessive driving fees. 5. Ranked based on combination of lowest fares and taxes first, then considering travel time benefits."
