    "disposable_income": "Magnolia Park is a predominantly working-class Hispanic neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 30% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited, making residents highly sensitive to increases in transit fares, driving fees, and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles for work commutes, while about 15% of households don't own vehicles and depend entirely on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit service improvements while minimizing financial impact on low-income residents"
