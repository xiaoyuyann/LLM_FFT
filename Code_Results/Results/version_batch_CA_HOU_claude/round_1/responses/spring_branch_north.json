    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch North residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income around $75,000, indicating capacity to absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has significant discretionary spending power with many middle to upper-middle class households who regularly shop at nearby retail centers and restaurants.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit options, most residents rely on personal vehicles to access jobs and services, though some bus routes serve the area.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency, policies with lower driving fees are preferred to minimize impact on majority of residents. 2) Higher sales tax is acceptable given income levels if it improves transit. 3) Moderate transit fares balance system funding with accessibility. 4) Prioritized options that reduce car travel times since most residents drive. 5) Selected policies that provide best overall time savings while keeping costs reasonable for both modes."
