    "disposable_income": "Northside/Northline is a working-class neighborhood with median household income around $36,000, significantly below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower income levels and higher poverty rates, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent bus service and METRORail Red Line access, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed job locations and limited transit coverage in some areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored moderate sales tax (1%) to balance transit funding with household budget impacts 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent workers 4) Selected options that reduce transit travel times to improve job accessibility 5) Balanced overall household cost burden across transportation modes given limited disposable income"
