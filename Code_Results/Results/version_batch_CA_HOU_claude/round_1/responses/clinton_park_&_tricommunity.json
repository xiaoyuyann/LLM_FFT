    "disposable_income": "Clinton Park / Tri-Community is a lower-income neighborhood with median household income around $25,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower income levels and higher poverty rates, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are highly sensitive to additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit service despite relatively low car ownership rates, with many residents relying on public transportation for essential trips.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-owning households. 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, recognizing both transit and car users in community. 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit travel time improvements while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents."
