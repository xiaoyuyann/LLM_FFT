    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has a median household income of around $45,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and higher cost of living concerns, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to both sales tax increases and transportation fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but is largely car-dependent, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and daily trips.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on overall purchasing power 2) Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to help fund transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced travel time improvements against cost increases 5) Selected proposals that offer meaningful transit time improvements while keeping combined costs manageable for lower-middle income residents"
