    "disposable_income": "West University Place residents have high disposable incomes with a median household income over $250,000, making them less sensitive to transit fares and driving fees.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has very high discretionary spending capacity with significant retail and dining expenditures, so even higher sales taxes would have minimal impact on quality of life.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent road access, high car ownership rates, and limited transit dependency, though it benefits from proximity to major employment centers and the Texas Medical Center.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high incomes, prioritize policies that reduce travel times over cost savings 2) Higher driving fees acceptable since residents can afford them and they reduce congestion 3) Moderate transit fares preferred to maintain service quality while not discouraging transit use 4) Higher sales tax tolerable given high discretionary spending 5) Focus on options that provide best overall time savings for both modes since some residents use transit to medical center"
