    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has a median household income of around $38,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",

    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being significant factors in daily life.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to support low-income residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5%-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that provide the best combination of accessibility and affordability for this lower-income community"
