    "disposable_income": "Northshore has a median household income of around $45,000, which is below Houston's average, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and a significant portion of the population being working class, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to both transit fares and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but heavy reliance on personal vehicles, with many residents commuting to industrial jobs along the Ship Channel and surrounding areas.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares and moderate taxes to help working-class residents who depend on transit. 2) Balanced driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent workers. 3) Sought options that reduce transit travel times to support commuters. 4) Considered the impact of sales tax on limited discretionary income. 5) Selected proposals that provide the best transit improvements while minimizing total cost burden on residents."
