    "accessibility": "The area has good road networks and moderate transit access with multiple bus routes, though most residents (80%+) commute by car, with average commute times of 25-30 minutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies that modestly increase driving fees to reduce congestion while keeping transit fares low to encourage mode shift. 2) Moderate sales tax increase (1%) balances revenue needs with consumption impact. 3) Selected proposals that achieve 22-23 minute car times and 54-56 minute transit times. 4) Favored proposals maintaining driving costs under $8/trip given car-dependent nature. 5) Ranked based on optimal balance of reduced travel times, reasonable costs, and community ability to absorb fees."
