    "disposable_income": "Fondren Gardens is a lower-middle income neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest incomes and high essential expenses, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with some bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being significant for both transit and driving.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given limited disposable income, prioritized lower taxes and fees while maintaining reasonable service levels 2) Selected policies that balance transit improvements without excessive cost burden 3) Favored proposals with 0.5-1.0% tax rates as 1.5% would strain household budgets 4) Considered both transit and driving improvements since residents use both modes 5) Ranked proposals that offer meaningful travel time reductions without highest combined costs"
