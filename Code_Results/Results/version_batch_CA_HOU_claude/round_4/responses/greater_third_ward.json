    "disposable_income": "Greater Third Ward has a median household income of approximately $23,000, significantly below Houston's average, with about 45% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has relatively good transit access with multiple bus routes and proximity to light rail, while about 20% of households lack access to a personal vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high poverty rates, prioritize lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain accessibility. 2. Prefer lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) due to limited disposable income. 3. Support moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Balance between improved transit times and cost burden on low-income residents. 5. Consider high transit dependency in the neighborhood when evaluating service quality improvements."
