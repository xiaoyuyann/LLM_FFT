    "disposable_income": "Meyerland is an affluent neighborhood with median household income above $100,000, indicating relatively high disposable income and ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power, with high retail activity along major corridors and proximity to shopping centers like Meyerland Plaza.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good car accessibility via Loop 610 and multiple major roads, with moderate transit access through METRO bus routes and relatively close proximity to light rail.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high income levels, policies with higher fees/taxes are acceptable if they improve service 2) Strong car dependency means moderate driving fees are preferred over highest fees 3) Higher transit fares are acceptable to fund better service since affordability is less critical 4) Moderate tax rates balance service improvements with maintaining discretionary spending 5) Prioritized options that reduce car travel times while reasonably improving transit times"
