    "disposable_income": "Clinton Park / Tri-Community is a lower-income neighborhood with median household income around $25,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate and limited disposable income, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit service despite relatively high transit dependency, with many residents relying on buses for essential trips while facing long travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent trips. 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, recognizing both transit and car users in community. 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit time improvements while keeping combined costs manageable for low-income residents."
