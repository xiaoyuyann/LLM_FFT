    "disposable_income": "Park Place has a median household income of approximately $38,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households living on modest incomes, discretionary spending is limited and residents are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of households owning cars while facing relatively long commute times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited household incomes 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Selected policies that achieve meaningful travel time improvements while minimizing cost burden 5) Balanced the need for transit system improvements with community's limited ability to pay higher taxes and fees"
