    "disposable_income": "Jensen is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $27,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With nearly 40% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to limited transit coverage and longer transit travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited disposable income. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) as many residents still need car access. 4. Balanced improved transit times with cost burden on low-income residents. 5. Selected proposals that provide best transit service improvements while minimizing financial impact on struggling households."
