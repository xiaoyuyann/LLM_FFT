    "disposable_income": "Kashmere Gardens is a low-income neighborhood with a median household income around $27,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With nearly 40% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles despite the financial burden, with average commute times being higher than city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lowest transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit time improvements while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents"
