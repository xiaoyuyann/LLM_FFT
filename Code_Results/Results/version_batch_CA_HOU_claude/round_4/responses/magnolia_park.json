    "disposable_income": "Magnolia Park is a predominantly working-class Hispanic neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 25% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited, making residents particularly sensitive to transit fares, driving fees, and sales tax increases.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles for work commutes, while about 15% of households don't own vehicles and depend entirely on public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to fund transit improvements 4) Sought balance between improved transit times and affordability 5) Considered that many residents make multiple trips per day, making per-trip costs particularly important"
