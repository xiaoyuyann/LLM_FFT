    "disposable_income": "Second Ward has a lower median household income around $31,000, with approximately 35% of residents living below the poverty line, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels and high poverty rate, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to increases in taxes, fares, and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good transit access with multiple bus routes and proximity to light rail, while about 20% of households lack vehicle access, making transit accessibility particularly important.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2) Favored moderate sales tax (1%) to support transit service improvements without overly burdening low-income residents. 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service while managing congestion. 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts on household budgets. 5) Considered the high proportion of transit users and car-free households in the community."
