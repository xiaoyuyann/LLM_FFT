    "disposable_income": "Hunterwood is a middle-income neighborhood with median household income around $55,000, indicating moderate disposable income levels for transportation expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity but are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees that could impact their household budgets.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good car accessibility but limited transit service, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and daily trips.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to preserve discretionary income given moderate household incomes, 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) over high fees ($1.00) since most residents are car-dependent, 3) Supported lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage occasional transit use while maintaining reasonable service levels, 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, preferring options that reduce car travel times to 23-24 minutes without excessive fees, 5) Selected policies that maintain transit accessibility while not overburdening household budgets with high taxes and fees."
