    "disposable_income": "Greenway/Upper Kirby is an affluent area with median household income well above Houston average, indicating high disposable income and less sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area features high-end retail, restaurants, and entertainment venues, suggesting residents have significant discretionary spending and can absorb higher transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good road infrastructure, moderate transit access with multiple bus routes, and is relatively close to employment centers, though most residents rely on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high income levels, prioritize policies that reduce travel time over cost savings 2) Support moderate to high driver fees to reduce congestion given the area's traffic density 3) Favor higher tax rates to fund transit improvements since residents can afford it 4) Accept higher transit fares since affordability is less critical 5) Balance between driving efficiency and transit improvement since both modes are important for the area"
