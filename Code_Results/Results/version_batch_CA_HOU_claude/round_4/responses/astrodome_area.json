    "disposable_income": "The Astrodome Area has relatively high median household income around $65,000, with many professionals working in the Texas Medical Center and surrounding institutions.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity, with significant retail and entertainment options in the area including NRG Stadium and various shopping centers.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit connectivity with Red Line light rail and multiple bus routes, as well as excellent road access via Loop 610, Highway 288, and other major arteries.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the mixed-income population and good transit infrastructure, policies balancing moderate taxes with lower transit fares would benefit both transit users and drivers. 2) The area's major employment centers and entertainment venues mean many residents make frequent trips, so per-trip costs significantly impact household budgets. 3) Moderate driving fees could help reduce congestion around major destinations while funding transit improvements. 4) Lower transit fares would encourage use of existing rail/bus infrastructure. 5) A moderate sales tax maintains funding while not overly burdening retail-heavy area."
