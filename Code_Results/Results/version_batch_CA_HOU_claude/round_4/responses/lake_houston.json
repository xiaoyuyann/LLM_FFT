    "disposable_income": "Lake Houston residents have relatively high median household incomes around $90,000, with most households having significant disposable income for transportation expenses.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area's residents generally have comfortable discretionary spending capacity, with many households able to afford private vehicles and regular retail/entertainment expenses.",
    "accessibility": "Lake Houston is a suburban area where most residents rely heavily on personal vehicles, with limited public transit options and longer distances to employment centers and amenities.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency and limited transit infrastructure, policies with lower driving fees are preferred. 2. Higher sales tax is acceptable given higher incomes and need for transit development. 3. Higher transit fares are acceptable since most residents drive. 4. Prioritized policies that minimize driving time while keeping driving costs reasonable. 5. Selected proposals that balance revenue generation for transit improvement while not overly burdening drivers."
