    "disposable_income": "The Greater Hobby Area has a median household income of approximately $45,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating residents are more sensitive to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With lower-than-average income levels and higher poverty rates, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to sales tax increases.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the area's relatively dispersed development pattern and proximity to Hobby Airport employment.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares and moderate taxes to help transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality. 2) Considered moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 3) Selected policies that balance travel time improvements with cost impacts. 4) Favored options that don't place excessive tax burden on limited discretionary income. 5) Chose proposals that provide meaningful transit improvements while keeping overall costs manageable for lower-income residents."
