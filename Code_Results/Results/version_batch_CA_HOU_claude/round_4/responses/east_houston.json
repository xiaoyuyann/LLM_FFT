    "disposable_income": "East Houston has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents living paycheck to paycheck and sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity with most income going to basic necessities, making residents particularly sensitive to both sales tax increases and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed job locations and limited frequent bus service, with average commute times being significant.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more affordable for cost-sensitive residents 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Sought balance between improved transit times and manageable costs 5) Ranked proposals that offered best combined time savings and affordability for both transit and car users"
