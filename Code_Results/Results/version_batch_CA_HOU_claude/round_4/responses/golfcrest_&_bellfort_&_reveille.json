    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has a median household income of around $38,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households living on modest incomes, discretionary spending is limited and residents are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being a significant concern for the working population.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5%-1.0%) due to limited household incomes 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers 4) Selected policies that provide meaningful travel time improvements while minimizing cost burden 5) Balanced the need for transit service improvements with the community's limited ability to pay higher taxes and fees"
