    "disposable_income": "The Greater OST / South Union area has a median household income of approximately $35,000, which is significantly below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate around 28% and many households spending over 30% of income on housing, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of households having access to a car while facing relatively long commute times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent households 4) Sought balance between improved transit times and affordable fares 5) Considered combined cost burden of tax+fare+fees on low-income households"
