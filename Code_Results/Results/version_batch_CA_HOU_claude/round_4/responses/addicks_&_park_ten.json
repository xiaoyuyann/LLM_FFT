    "disposable_income": "Addicks / Park Ten residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income above $100,000, indicating greater ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area's affluent population has significant discretionary spending power and tends to prioritize convenience and time savings over minor cost differences.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with limited transit options, long commute distances to major employment centers, and most residents rely on personal vehicles for transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies that reduce car travel times since most residents are car-dependent. 2) Higher driver fees acceptable given income levels and potential for reduced congestion. 3) Lower transit fares less critical since transit usage is limited. 4) Moderate sales tax preferred to balance revenue needs with tax burden. 5) Selected policies that provide best car travel time improvements while maintaining reasonable total costs."
