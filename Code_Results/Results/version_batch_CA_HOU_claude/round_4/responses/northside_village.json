    "disposable_income": "Northside Village has a relatively low median household income around $33,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 30% of residents living below poverty level and high housing cost burden, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has decent bus service coverage but limited rail access, with many residents relying on public transit, while others depend on personal vehicles for work commutes to various parts of Houston.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent workers 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit service improvements while keeping overall costs manageable for low-income residents"
