    "disposable_income": "Memorial is one of Houston's most affluent areas with median household income over $140,000, indicating high disposable income and less sensitivity to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power with high-end retail centers and shopping destinations, suggesting they can absorb higher taxes and fees with minimal impact on lifestyle.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit access, featuring good road infrastructure connecting to major employment centers and retail destinations.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high car dependency and income levels, policies with higher driving fees are acceptable if they reduce congestion and travel times. 2. Higher sales tax is less impactful due to high disposable income. 3. Transit fare levels are less relevant since most residents drive. 4. Prioritized policies that minimize car travel time while accepting higher costs. 5. Selected proposals that balance revenue generation for system improvements with reasonable cost increases."
