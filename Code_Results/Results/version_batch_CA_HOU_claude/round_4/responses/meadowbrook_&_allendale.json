    "disposable_income": "Meadowbrook/Allendale is a working-class neighborhood with median household income around $45,000, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have modest discretionary spending capacity, with many households being cost-sensitive to transportation expenses and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being significant factor in transportation choices.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on household budgets, 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep public transit affordable for working families, 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents, 4) Sought balance between reduced travel times and cost increases, 5) Considered that many residents make multiple trips per day and need cost-effective options for both transit and driving"
