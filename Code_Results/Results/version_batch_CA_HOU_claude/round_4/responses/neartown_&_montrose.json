    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good walkability, decent transit access with multiple bus routes, and relatively easy driving access to downtown, medical center, and other employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the higher income levels, residents can absorb moderate tax/fee increases if they lead to better transportation options 2) The area's mixed-use character means both transit and driving improvements are valuable 3) The dense urban form makes transit improvements particularly impactful 4) Many residents both drive and use transit, so balanced policies are preferred 5) Selected policies that reduce travel times while keeping costs moderate 6) Prioritized options that improve transit service without excessive driving penalties 7) Considered that many residents make frequent local trips, so per-trip costs add up"
