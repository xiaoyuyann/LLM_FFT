    "disposable_income": "Westbranch is a middle-income neighborhood with median household income around $45,000, indicating moderate sensitivity to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have modest discretionary spending capacity, with typical household retail spending around $20,000 annually, making them somewhat sensitive to sales tax changes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good road access but limited transit service, with about 70% of residents commuting by car and 20% by transit, suggesting policies should balance both modes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with moderate tax rates (1%) to balance revenue needs and household budgets. 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to support transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality. 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to manage congestion without excessive burden on majority car-commuting population. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both modes, with special attention to transit time reductions. 5) Selected proposals that offer best combined benefits in terms of travel time savings and reasonable costs for both transit and car users."
