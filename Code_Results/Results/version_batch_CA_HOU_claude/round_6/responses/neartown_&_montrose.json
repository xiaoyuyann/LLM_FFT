    "disposable_income": "Neartown-Montrose residents have relatively high disposable income with median household income around $87,000, significantly above Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has high discretionary spending capacity, with residents frequently patronizing local restaurants, bars, retail shops, and entertainment venues in this culturally vibrant area.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good walkability, decent transit access with multiple bus routes, and relatively short driving distances to major employment centers, though many residents rely on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the higher income levels, residents can better absorb moderate tax/fee increases if they improve service quality 2) The area's mixed-use character means both transit and driving improvements are valuable 3) The dense urban form makes transit improvements particularly impactful 4) Proposals balancing moderate taxes with meaningful service improvements are preferred 5) Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times significantly while keeping costs reasonable 6) Prioritized options that reduce car travel times to benefit both transit and car users 7) Considered that many residents make frequent local trips, so per-trip costs are important"
