    "disposable_income": "Jensen has a median household income of approximately $31,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate of around 35%, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed job locations and limited direct transit connections.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares and taxes due to low income levels 2) Balanced driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents 3) Selected policies that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility 4) Considered combined impact of sales tax and per-trip costs on limited household budgets 5) Favored proposals that provide meaningful transit improvements while minimizing total cost burden"
