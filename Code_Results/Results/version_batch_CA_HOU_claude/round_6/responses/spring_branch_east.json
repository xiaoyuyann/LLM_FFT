    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch East has a median household income of around $48,000, which is slightly below Houston's median, indicating moderate disposable income levels with some budget constraints.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending capacity, with approximately 30-35% of income available after essential expenses, making them sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate car dependency with some bus service along major corridors, but limited transit connectivity to employment centers, with about 80% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to preserve discretionary income given moderate household incomes. 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without excessive burden on car-dependent residents. 3) Selected lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to make transit more accessible. 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5) Considered the high car dependency while trying to improve transit options."
