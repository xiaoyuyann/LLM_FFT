    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance revenue needs with household budget impacts 3) Supported modest driving fees ($0.50) to encourage transit use without overly burdening drivers 4) Selected options that reduce both transit and driving times 5) Considered the combined impact of taxes, fares, and fees on household budgets"
