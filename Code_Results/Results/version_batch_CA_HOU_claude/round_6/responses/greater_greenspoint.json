    "disposable_income": "Greater Greenspoint has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents living below the poverty line and facing significant financial constraints.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending capacity, with a high proportion of income going to essential needs like housing and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit service but high car dependency, with about 75% of residents commuting by car and facing significant transportation costs relative to their income.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help low-income residents who rely on transit. 2. Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, recognizing both transit users and drivers in the community. 5. Selected proposals that offer the best combination of affordability and service improvements for this lower-income area."
