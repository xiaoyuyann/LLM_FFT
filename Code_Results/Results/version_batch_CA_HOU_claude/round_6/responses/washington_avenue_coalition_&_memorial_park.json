    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has relatively high disposable income with median household income over $100,000, indicating residents can generally absorb higher transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power and tend to value time savings over minor cost increases, with high retail and entertainment spending in the area.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good road access but moderate transit service, with many residents relying on cars while having the option to use METRO bus routes and the Red Line light rail within reasonable distance.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies that reduce travel times for both modes since residents value time savings and can afford higher costs. 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1.0%) that improve transit without excessive burden. 3) Supported higher driving fees to reduce congestion given the area's traffic challenges. 4) Considered moderate transit fares to maintain service quality while keeping transit competitive. 5) Selected proposals that balance travel time improvements with reasonable cost increases given the area's income levels."
