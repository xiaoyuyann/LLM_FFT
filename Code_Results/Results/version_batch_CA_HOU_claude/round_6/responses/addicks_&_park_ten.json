    "disposable_income": "Addicks / Park Ten residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income above $100,000, indicating greater ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area's affluent population has significant discretionary spending capacity and tends to prioritize convenience and time savings over cost savings.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with limited transit access, featuring major employment centers and retail along I-10 corridor where most residents rely on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency and income levels, policies that reduce car travel time are priority. 2) Higher driver fees are acceptable if they significantly improve travel times. 3) Lower transit fares less critical due to limited transit usage. 4) Moderate tax rates preferred to balance service improvements with tax burden. 5) Selected policies that provide best car travel time reductions while keeping tax rate reasonable."
