    "disposable_income": "Sharpstown has a median household income of approximately $38,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a significant portion of residents being lower-middle income, discretionary spending is constrained and residents are sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good car accessibility with proximity to major highways (Southwest Freeway and Beltway 8), but limited transit options with primarily bus services and longer transit travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given lower incomes, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden to maintain affordability. 2. Consider moderate driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3. Balance between travel time improvements and cost impacts, as many residents rely on both cars and transit. 4. Focus on proposals that reduce transit travel times to improve accessibility for transit-dependent residents. 5. Select policies that provide meaningful service improvements while minimizing financial burden on the community."
