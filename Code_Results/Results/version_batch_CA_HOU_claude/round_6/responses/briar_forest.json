    "disposable_income": "Briar Forest residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income around $75,000, indicating capacity to absorb moderate transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has significant discretionary spending power with many retail centers and restaurants, suggesting residents can manage higher sales taxes without severe impact on quality of life.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood is car-dependent with limited transit options, longer transit travel times, and high car ownership rates, making driving the dominant mode of transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) since most residents drive and would be disproportionately impacted by high sales tax. 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion without excessive burden on car-dependent residents. 3) Supported lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage transit use while maintaining service quality. 4) Selected proposals that achieve good balance between car travel time reduction and reasonable cost increases. 5) Considered the area's higher income levels that can absorb moderate fee increases for better overall transportation system performance."
