    "disposable_income": "Independence Heights has a relatively low median household income of around $33,000, with approximately 30% of residents living below the poverty line, making them particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",

    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with about 75% of households owning at least one car, though many struggle with maintenance costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with tax burden 3) Selected proposals with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users 5) Focused on options that minimize total transportation costs for low-income residents"
