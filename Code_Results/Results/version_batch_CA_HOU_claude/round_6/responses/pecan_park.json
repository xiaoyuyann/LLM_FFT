    "disposable_income": "Pecan Park has a median household income of around $35,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of working-class families and a poverty rate above 25%, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles for work commutes, with about 75% of residents driving alone to work.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the low income levels, prioritized proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden to maintain affordability. 2) Selected options that provide reasonable transit improvements without excessive driving fees, as many residents depend on cars. 3) Balanced the need for system improvements with the community's limited ability to absorb additional costs. 4) Considered that improved transit service could benefit the significant transit-dependent population. 5) Aimed to minimize total transportation cost burden while maximizing service improvements."
