    "disposable_income": "The Astrodome Area has relatively high median household income around $65,000, with many professionals working in the Texas Medical Center and surrounding institutions.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity, with significant retail and entertainment options in the area including NRG Stadium and various shopping centers.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit connectivity with Red Line light rail and multiple bus routes, as well as excellent road access via Loop 610, Highway 288, and other major arteries.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the mixed-income population and good transit infrastructure, prioritized policies that balance moderate fares with improved service. 2) Selected options with moderate sales tax (1%) to maintain service quality without overly burdening retail spending. 3) Supported modest driving fees to reduce congestion around major destinations like medical center and stadium events. 4) Favored proposals that achieve significant transit time improvements while keeping costs reasonable. 5) Considered that many residents have choice between driving and transit, so policies should optimize both modes."
