    "disposable_income": "Clinton Park / Tri-Community is a lower-income neighborhood with median household income around $25,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate and limited disposable income, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are highly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit service despite relatively high transit dependency, with many residents relying on buses for essential trips while facing long travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without excessive burden. 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost sensitivity. 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit travel time reductions while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents."
