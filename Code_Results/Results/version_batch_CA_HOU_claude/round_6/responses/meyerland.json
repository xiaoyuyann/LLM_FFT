    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high income levels, policies with higher fees/taxes are acceptable if they improve service 2) Strong car dependency suggests preference for balanced improvements in both modes 3) Higher driver fees could help fund transit without overly burdening residents 4) Moderate tax rates preferred to maintain retail competitiveness 5) Lower transit fares could encourage mode shift while being affordable to implement given the tax base"
