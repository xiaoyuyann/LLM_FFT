    "disposable_income": "South Park is a lower-income community with a median household income around $31,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 30% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being higher than city average due to its location.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost burden 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit service improvements while minimizing financial impact on low-income residents"
