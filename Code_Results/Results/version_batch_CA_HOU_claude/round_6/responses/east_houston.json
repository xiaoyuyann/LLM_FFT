    "disposable_income": "East Houston has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents living paycheck to paycheck and sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity with most income going to basic necessities, making residents particularly sensitive to both sales tax increases and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit coverage but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed job locations and limited frequent transit service.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to keep transit affordable for transit-dependent residents 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers 4) Sought balance between improved travel times and cost impacts 5) Ranked proposals that provide meaningful transit improvements without excessive financial burden on low-income residents"
