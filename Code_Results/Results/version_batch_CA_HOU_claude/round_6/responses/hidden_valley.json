    "disposable_income": "Hidden Valley residents have moderate to low disposable income with a median household income around $45,000, indicating sensitivity to transportation costs and taxes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has limited discretionary spending capacity, with most income going to essential needs like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with bus routes but relies heavily on personal vehicles, with about 85% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low disposable income, prioritized lower transit fares and taxes to preserve household budgets. 2. Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 3. Balanced travel time improvements against cost increases. 4. Selected policies that reduce car travel times to benefit majority of car commuters. 5. Favored proposals with 0.5-1.0% tax rates as 1.5% would strain household budgets."
