    "disposable_income": "MacGregor has a moderate to high median household income around $65,000, with a mix of professionals and academics due to proximity to Texas Medical Center and University of Houston.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity but are price-sensitive to transportation costs given the frequent trips to nearby employment and education centers.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good access to major employment centers via both car and transit, with MetroRail Red Line nearby and multiple bus routes, though many residents still rely on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with moderate tax rates (1%) to balance transit funding and household budget impact 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage transit use given proximity to rail/bus 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Selected options that achieve meaningful travel time improvements for both modes 5) Considered the neighborhood's mixed-income population and need for affordable transportation options"
