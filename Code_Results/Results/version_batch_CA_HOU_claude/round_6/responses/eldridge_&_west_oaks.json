    "disposable_income": "Eldridge/West Oaks is an affluent area with median household income around $85,000, indicating relatively high disposable income and ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power with high retail activity in the area including Memorial City Mall and CityCentre, suggesting less sensitivity to moderate tax increases.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with limited transit options, longer transit travel times, and most residents relying on personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency, prioritize proposals with lower driving fees to minimize impact on majority of residents. 2) Can accept moderate sales tax increases due to higher disposable income. 3) Higher transit fares acceptable since transit usage is low. 4) Focus on proposals that reduce car travel times since most residents drive. 5) Balance between maintaining car accessibility while gradually improving transit service."
