    "accessibility": "The area has good road networks and moderate transit access with multiple bus routes, though many residents are car-dependent for commuting to major employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized balanced proposals that improve transit service while keeping driving viable given the car-dependent nature of many residents. 2) Selected moderate tax rates (1.0%) that can fund transit improvements without excessive burden on high discretionary spending. 3) Favored proposals with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to reduce congestion while avoiding severe impact on necessary car trips. 4) Considered lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to encourage transit use among service workers and younger residents. 5) Focused on proposals showing significant transit time improvements to make it a more viable option."
