    "disposable_income": "Second Ward has a lower median household income around $31,000, with approximately 35% of residents living below the poverty line, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels and high poverty rate, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to increases in taxes, fares, and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good access to METRO bus routes and light rail, with about 25% of households not owning a vehicle, making transit accessibility particularly important for this community.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents, 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income, 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households, 4) Balanced improved transit times with cost impacts, 5) Selected proposals that provide the best transit service improvements while minimizing financial burden on low-income residents."
