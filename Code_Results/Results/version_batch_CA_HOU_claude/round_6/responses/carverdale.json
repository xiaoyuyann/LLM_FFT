    "disposable_income": "Carverdale has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited public transit access with infrequent bus service, high car dependency for work commutes to industrial areas, and relatively long travel times to major employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5%) due to limited disposable income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more accessible. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) as many residents rely on cars for work. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts. 5. Selected proposals that minimize overall transportation cost burden while maintaining reasonable service levels."
