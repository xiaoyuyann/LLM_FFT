    "disposable_income": "Clear Lake residents have relatively high disposable income with median household income around $80,000, significantly above Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area shows strong discretionary spending capacity with high rates of retail activity and numerous shopping centers, suggesting residents can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "accessibility": "Clear Lake is a car-dependent suburban area with limited transit options, longer distances to downtown, and high car ownership rates, though some residents use park-and-ride services for commuting.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) since area's high consumption means tax impact is significant. 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without severely impacting car-dependent residents. 3) Accepted moderate transit fares ($1.25) as area residents can afford it while supporting service quality. 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts, noting most residents drive. 5) Selected policies that provide meaningful transit improvements for park-and-ride users while maintaining reasonable driving conditions."
