    "disposable_income": "Willow Meadows/Willowbend is an upper-middle-income neighborhood with median household income around $100,000, indicating relatively high disposable income and ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power and tend to prioritize quality of life, with many households able to afford multiple vehicles and regular retail/entertainment spending.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good road access via Loop 610 and Main Street, with moderate transit access through MetroRail and bus routes, though most residents are car-dependent for daily trips.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car ownership and income levels, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve transit; 2) Higher sales tax is less impactful due to high disposable income; 3) Moderate transit fares balance system funding with accessibility; 4) Prioritized options that reduce both car and transit travel times; 5) Selected policies that encourage multimodal improvements while maintaining reasonable costs for both transit and driving users."
