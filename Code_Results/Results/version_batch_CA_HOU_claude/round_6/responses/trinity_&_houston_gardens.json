    "disposable_income": "Trinity/Houston Gardens is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity, with a high percentage of income already committed to essential needs like housing and utilities.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited public transit coverage with longer walking distances to bus stops, while car ownership rates are lower than city average, making residents particularly sensitive to both transit fares and driving costs.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain transit affordability\n2. Selected lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases\n3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) as a compromise to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers\n4. Prioritized proposals that offer significant transit time improvements to benefit transit-dependent residents\n5. Balanced the need for service improvements with the community's limited ability to absorb additional costs"
