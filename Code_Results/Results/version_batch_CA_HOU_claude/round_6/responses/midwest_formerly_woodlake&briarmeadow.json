    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary income 2) Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to encourage transit use without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Selected proposals that achieve meaningful travel time improvements for both modes 5) Balanced revenue generation for transit improvements with household budget impacts"
