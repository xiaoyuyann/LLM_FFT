    "disposable_income": "Denver Harbor/Port Houston is a working-class neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 30% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has some bus service but limited transit infrastructure overall, with many residents relying on personal vehicles despite the financial burden, and about 15% of households lacking vehicle access.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) due to limited household incomes 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that provide the best accessibility improvements for the lowest combined cost burden"
