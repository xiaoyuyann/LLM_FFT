    "disposable_income": "Greater Third Ward has a median household income of approximately $23,000, significantly below Houston's average, with about 45% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has relatively good transit access with multiple bus routes and proximity to light rail, while about 20% of households lack access to a personal vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given low income levels, prioritize proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden. 2. Consider high transit dependency and need for reliable service. 3. Support moderate driver fees to improve transit without overly burdening residents who must drive. 4. Balance between service improvements and cost burden. 5. Selected proposals 6, 7, 0, 1, 8 as they offer the best combination of low transit fares ($0.75) and moderate tax rates, while providing improved transit service through varying driver fees."
