    "disposable_income": "The Greater Hobby Area has a median household income below Houston's average, with approximately 20% of households living below the poverty line, making residents particularly sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower income levels, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are more likely to prioritize essential expenses over additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes, but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to the area's proximity to Hobby Airport and industrial employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more accessible to lower-income residents 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as a compromise to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers 4) Selected policies that achieve reasonable transit time improvements while minimizing overall cost burden 5) Considered the high proportion of car-dependent workers who need reliable commute times to airport and industrial jobs"
