    "disposable_income": "The median household income in East Little York / Homestead is relatively low at around $35,000, with many residents living on fixed or limited incomes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending capacity, with a significant portion of income going to basic necessities like housing, food, and transportation.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being higher than the city average.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given low income levels, prioritized proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden to preserve disposable income. 2) Selected options that reduce transit travel time to benefit transit-dependent residents. 3) Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4) Balanced improved transit access against tax impacts. 5) Considered both car and transit travel time improvements since community uses both modes."
