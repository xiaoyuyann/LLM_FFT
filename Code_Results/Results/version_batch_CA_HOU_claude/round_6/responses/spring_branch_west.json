    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch West has a median household income of around $55,000, placing it in the middle-income range for Houston, with approximately 15% of residents below poverty level.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity but are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees, with significant portions of income already going to housing and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The area is primarily car-dependent with limited transit options, featuring several major thoroughfares like I-10 and Beltway 8, while bus service is available but with longer travel times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5-1.0%) to protect discretionary spending power 2) Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents 3) Selected proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to make transit more accessible 4) Balanced travel time improvements for both modes given the mixed-income population 5) Considered the area's car-dependency while supporting gradual transit improvements"
