    "disposable_income": "Greater Inwood has a median household income of around $45,000, which is below Houston's median, indicating residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With modest income levels and higher poverty rates than city average, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to both sales tax increases and transportation fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with some bus routes but is largely car-dependent, with about 80% of residents commuting by car and facing significant travel times to employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents while maintaining reasonable service levels. 2) Favored moderate sales tax (1.0%) over higher rates to balance transit funding with household budget impacts. 3) Selected proposals with moderate driving fees ($0.50) to encourage some transit use without overly burdening car-dependent residents. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both modes given the area's mixed transit-car usage. 5) Aimed to minimize overall cost burden on lower-income residents while maintaining adequate transit service."
