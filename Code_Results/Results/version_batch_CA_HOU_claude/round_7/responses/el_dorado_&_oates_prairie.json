    "disposable_income": "El Dorado / Oates Prairie is a working-class neighborhood with lower-middle income levels, where households have limited disposable income and are sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have modest discretionary spending capacity and need to carefully balance essential expenses with transportation costs, making them particularly sensitive to both sales tax increases and transit fares.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access but is largely car-dependent, with many residents relying on personal vehicles for daily commutes and errands.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower sales tax (0.5%) to minimize impact on household budgets 2) Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Selected proposals that achieve reasonable balance between car and transit travel times 5) Ranked proposals that minimize combined financial impact while maximizing transportation efficiency"
