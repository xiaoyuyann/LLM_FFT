    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has a median household income of around $38,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's median, indicating limited disposable income for most residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of households living on modest incomes, discretionary spending is limited and residents are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being significant concern for working families.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5%-1.0%) due to limited household incomes 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that provide the best accessibility improvements while minimizing financial burden on low-income residents"
