    "disposable_income": "Braeburn has a median household income of around $45,000, which is below Houston's average, indicating moderate financial constraints for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With moderate income levels and significant housing costs, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate car dependency with limited transit options, though it has access to major arterials and is served by some METRO bus routes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to protect limited discretionary income 2) Favored moderate transit fares ($0.75-$1.25) to keep transit affordable while maintaining service quality 3) Supported modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts 5) Selected proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 57 minutes while keeping driving costs manageable"
