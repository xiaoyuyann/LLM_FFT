    "accessibility": "The area has good road access but limited transit options, with most residents relying on cars while having interest in better transit connectivity to downtown and other employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized balanced proposals that improve transit service while keeping driving viable given current car dependency. 2) Selected moderate tax rates (1.0-1.5%) that can fund transit improvements without excessive burden on high discretionary spending. 3) Favored proposals with $0.75-$1.25 transit fares to encourage ridership. 4) Included modest driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to manage congestion while reflecting ability to pay. 5) Focused on options that reduce both transit and driving times significantly from current levels."
