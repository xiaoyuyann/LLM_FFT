    "disposable_income": "Magnolia Park is a predominantly working-class Hispanic neighborhood with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low median income, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles for work commutes, while being located relatively close to downtown Houston.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given low income levels, prioritized proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden. 2) Selected options that balance driving fees to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent workers. 3) Considered proposals that offer meaningful transit time improvements to benefit both transit users and drivers. 4) Favored proposals that minimize combined impact of sales tax and transportation costs. 5) Prioritized options that provide best accessibility improvements for the cost burden."
