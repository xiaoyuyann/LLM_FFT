    "disposable_income": "Alief has a median household income of around $46,000, which is below Houston's median, with approximately 18% of residents living below the poverty line, indicating limited disposable income for many residents.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the lower-than-average income levels and high percentage of working-class families, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "Alief is heavily car-dependent with limited public transit options, though it has some bus routes connecting to major employment centers, and about 15% of households don't own vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance service improvements with tax burden 3) Selected moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers 4) Considered proposals that reduce transit travel times to benefit working commuters 5) Balanced overall cost impact on lower-income residents with need for service improvements"
