    "disposable_income": "Greater Eastwood has a median household income around $53,000, which is below Houston's median, suggesting residents are price-sensitive to transportation costs.",

    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good access to downtown via multiple bus routes and light rail, with about 20% of residents using public transit for commuting, while most households own at least one car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to support transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality. 2) Favored moderate sales tax (1.0%) to balance transit funding with household budget impacts. 3) Supported moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening drivers. 4) Considered travel time improvements for both transit and car users. 5) Selected policies that provide the best balance of accessibility and affordability for mixed-mode transportation neighborhood."
