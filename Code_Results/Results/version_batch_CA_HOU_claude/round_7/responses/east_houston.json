    "disposable_income": "East Houston has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents living paycheck to paycheck and sensitive to additional transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Limited discretionary spending capacity with most income going to basic necessities, making residents particularly vulnerable to increased taxes and fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to dispersed job locations and limited frequent bus service.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower tax rates (0.5%) to minimize impact on limited disposable income 2) Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to keep transit affordable for transit-dependent residents 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers 4) Sought balance between travel time improvements and cost increases 5) Considered proposals that provide meaningful transit improvements without excessive financial burden on low-income residents"
