    "disposable_income": "The Astrodome Area has relatively high median household income around $65,000, with many professionals working in the Texas Medical Center and surrounding institutions.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate to high discretionary spending capacity, with significant retail and entertainment options in the area including NRG Stadium and various shopping centers.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good transit connectivity with Red Line light rail and multiple bus routes, as well as excellent road access via Loop 610, Highway 288, and other major arteries.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the mixed-income population and good transit infrastructure, prioritized balanced policies that maintain reasonable transit fares while improving service. 2) Selected moderate tax rates (1.0-1.5%) that can fund transit improvements without overly burdening residents. 3) Supported modest driving fees to reduce congestion around major destinations like the Medical Center and NRG Stadium. 4) Favored proposals that reduce transit travel times to under 55 minutes while keeping fares affordable. 5) Considered that many residents have choice between driving and transit, so policies should optimize both modes."
