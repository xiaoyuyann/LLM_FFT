    "disposable_income": "Jensen is a lower-income neighborhood with a median household income around $31,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity, with a high percentage of income going to basic necessities like housing and food.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles due to job locations and schedule needs, with about 75% of residents commuting by car.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given low incomes, prioritized lower transit fares and sales tax to preserve disposable income 2) Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 3) Balanced travel time improvements for both transit and car users 4) Selected policies that provide best transit improvements while keeping combined tax/fare burden manageable 5) Avoided highest tax/fee combinations that would strain household budgets"
