    "disposable_income": "The median household income in East Little York / Homestead is relatively low at around $35,000, with many residents living on fixed or limited incomes.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have limited discretionary spending capacity, with a significant portion of income going to basic necessities like housing, utilities, and food.",
    "accessibility": "The area has moderate transit access with bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles, with average commute times being significant for both transit and driving modes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given low income levels, prioritized proposals with lower transit fares and sales tax burden to preserve disposable income. 2) Selected options that reduce transit travel time to benefit transit-dependent residents. 3) Moderate driving fees acceptable to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4) Balanced improved transit times against combined cost impact of taxes and fares. 5) Considered that many residents make multiple trips per day, so per-trip costs have multiplied impact."
