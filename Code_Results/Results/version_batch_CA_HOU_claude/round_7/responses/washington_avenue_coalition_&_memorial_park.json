    "disposable_income": "The neighborhood has relatively high disposable income with median household income over $100,000, indicating residents can generally absorb higher transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have significant discretionary spending power and tend to value time savings over minor cost increases, with high retail and entertainment spending in the area.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good road access but moderate transit service, with many residents relying on cars while having the financial means to choose between driving and transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies that reduce travel times for both modes since residents value time highly. 2) Higher income means residents can handle moderate fee increases if they improve service. 3) Selected balanced policies that improve transit while maintaining reasonable driving options. 4) Favored proposals with moderate rather than highest tax rates since many residents drive. 5) Considered that many residents make discretionary trips to restaurants and entertainment, so travel time reliability is important."
