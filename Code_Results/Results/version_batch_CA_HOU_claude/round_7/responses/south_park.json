    "disposable_income": "South Park is a lower-income community with a median household income around $31,000, significantly below Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With about 30% of residents living below poverty level, discretionary spending is very limited and residents are highly sensitive to any additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate bus service but limited rail access, with many residents dependent on public transit, while those who drive face significant transportation costs relative to their income.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent households 4) Balanced travel time improvements with cost sensitivity 5) Selected proposals that provide best transit service improvements while minimizing financial burden on low-income residents"
