    "disposable_income": "Greater Third Ward has a median household income of approximately $23,000, significantly below Houston's average, with about 45% of residents living below the poverty line.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional transportation costs and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has relatively good transit access with multiple bus routes and proximity to light rail, while about 20% of households lack access to a personal vehicle.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) due to high transit dependency and low income levels. 2. Favored moderate driving fees ($0.50-$1.00) to improve transit service while generating revenue. 3. Preferred lower sales tax rates (0.5%-1.0%) to minimize impact on essential purchases. 4. Selected policies that achieve significant transit time improvements while keeping costs affordable. 5. Balanced the need for transit service improvements with the community's limited ability to pay higher taxes and fees."
