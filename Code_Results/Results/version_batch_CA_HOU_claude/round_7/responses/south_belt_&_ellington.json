    "disposable_income": "South Belt / Ellington has a moderate median household income around $65,000, with many working-class and middle-class families who are sensitive to transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending power but need to carefully balance transportation costs with other household expenses, as many are commuters with regular transportation needs.",
    "accessibility": "The area is car-dependent with limited transit options, located far from downtown, and most residents rely on personal vehicles for commuting and daily activities.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the car-dependent nature and moderate income levels, prioritized proposals with lower driving fees and sales tax to minimize impact on household budgets. 2) Selected proposals that offer reasonable transit improvements without excessive costs, as most residents are car-dependent. 3) Balanced the need for some transit investment through moderate sales tax while avoiding highest tax rates. 4) Considered that lower transit fares would have limited benefit since most residents drive. 5) Focused on proposals that minimize total transportation costs while maintaining reasonable service levels."
