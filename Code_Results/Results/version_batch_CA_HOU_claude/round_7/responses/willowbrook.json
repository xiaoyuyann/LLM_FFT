    "disposable_income": "Willowbrook residents have relatively high disposable incomes with a median household income above Houston's average, as it is predominantly a middle to upper-middle-class suburban area.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has significant discretionary spending capacity with numerous retail centers and shopping destinations, including Willowbrook Mall, suggesting residents can absorb moderate transportation cost increases.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with limited public transit options, primarily served by park-and-ride facilities and bus routes, with most residents relying on personal vehicles for daily commutes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the high car dependency and income levels, policies with moderate driving fees are acceptable if they improve transit service 2) Lower sales tax rates are preferred since residents make significant retail purchases 3) Transit fares are less critical since current transit usage is low 4) Prioritized policies that balance driving costs with improved transit times 5) Selected options that maintain reasonable car travel times while funding transit improvements through moderate fees and taxes"
