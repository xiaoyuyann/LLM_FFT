    "disposable_income": "Pecan Park has a median household income of around $38,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high percentage of working-class families and a poverty rate above 25%, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to both fare increases and sales tax changes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with several bus routes but many residents rely on personal vehicles for work commutes, with average car ownership rates and significant transit commute times.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to support low-income residents who depend on public transit. 2) Favored moderate sales tax rates (1.0%) to balance transit funding with household budget impacts. 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent workers. 4) Selected options that reduce transit travel times to under 56 minutes to benefit commuters. 5) Balanced overall household cost impact with service improvements."
