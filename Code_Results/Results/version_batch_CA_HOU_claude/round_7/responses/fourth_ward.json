    "disposable_income": "Fourth Ward residents have relatively low disposable income with a median household income around $35,000, significantly below Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With high housing costs consuming a large portion of income and 30% poverty rate, residents have limited discretionary spending capacity and are price-sensitive to additional fees and taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has good transit access being close to downtown with multiple bus routes, but also high car dependency with 75% of residents commuting by car, while 15% use public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized lower transit fares ($0.75) to help transit-dependent residents while maintaining service quality 2) Favored moderate tax rates (1%) to balance revenue needs with resident affordability 3) Supported modest driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit without overly burdening drivers 4) Considered travel time improvements for both modes 5) Selected proposals that reduce congestion while keeping costs manageable for low-income residents"
