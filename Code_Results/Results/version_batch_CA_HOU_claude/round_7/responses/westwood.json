    "disposable_income": "Westwood has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with approximately 30% of households living below the poverty line, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are highly sensitive to additional taxes, fares, and fees that would reduce their already limited purchasing power.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has moderate transit access with some bus routes but high car dependency, with about 75% of residents commuting by car and experiencing significant travel times to reach employment centers and services.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized policies with lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more affordable for low-income residents 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary spending 3) Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service while not overly burdening car-dependent residents 4) Selected policies that achieve reasonable balance between transit improvement and cost burden 5) Ranked options that provide meaningful travel time improvements while keeping combined costs manageable for residents"
