    "disposable_income": "Addicks / Park Ten residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income above $100,000, indicating greater ability to absorb transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area's affluent population has significant discretionary spending power and tends to prioritize convenience and time savings over minor cost differences.",
    "accessibility": "The area is heavily car-dependent with limited transit access, featuring major highways (I-10, Beltway 8) and primarily serving as an employment center with office parks and retail.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the car-dependent nature and high income levels, policies that reduce car travel times while moderately increasing costs are preferred. 2) Higher driver fees are acceptable as they'll reduce congestion and improve travel times. 3) Lower transit fares are less critical since transit usage is limited. 4) Moderate to higher tax rates can be absorbed by the affluent population while funding better services. 5) Prioritized policies that provide the best car travel time improvements while keeping tax burden reasonable."
