    "disposable_income": "Acres Home has a median household income of approximately $35,000, which is significantly lower than Houston's average, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "With a high poverty rate around 28% and many households being cost-burdened by housing, residents have very limited discretionary spending capacity and are sensitive to additional taxes or fees.",
    "accessibility": "The area has limited transit coverage with some bus routes but no rail service, while about 20% of households lack vehicle access, making both transit affordability and service quality critical issues.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain transit affordability for transit-dependent residents, 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income, 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent households, 4) Sought balance between transit time improvements and cost burden on low-income residents, 5) Considered high car-dependency while acknowledging significant transit-dependent population"
