    "disposable_income": "South Main residents have relatively high disposable income with a median household income above Houston's average, as it includes affluent areas near Rice University and the Medical Center.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The area has high discretionary spending capacity with residents frequently using retail, dining, and entertainment options along Main Street and Rice Village.",
    "accessibility": "The area has excellent transit access with the Red Line light rail, multiple bus routes, and good road networks, while being close to major employment centers and amenities.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Given high income levels, the community can tolerate higher taxes/fees to improve transit service. 2. Many residents use both cars and transit, so balanced improvements to both modes are valuable. 3. The area would benefit from reduced congestion due to its central location. 4. Higher driver fees could encourage more transit use along the existing Red Line. 5. Selected policies that provide significant travel time improvements while keeping transit fares moderate to maintain accessibility. 6. Prioritized options with 1.0-1.5% tax rates that can fund substantial service improvements."
