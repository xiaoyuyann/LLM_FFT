    "disposable_income": "Neartown-Montrose residents have relatively high disposable income with median household income around $87,000, significantly above Houston's average.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "The neighborhood has high discretionary spending capacity, with residents frequently patronizing local restaurants, bars, retail shops, and entertainment venues in this culturally vibrant area.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good walkability, decent transit access with multiple bus routes, and relatively short driving distances to major employment centers, though many residents rely on personal vehicles.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given the higher income levels, residents can absorb moderate tax/fee increases if they lead to better service; 2) The area's mixed-use character means both transit and driving improvements are valuable; 3) The dense urban form makes transit improvements particularly impactful; 4) Many residents use both transit and driving, so balanced improvements to both modes are preferred; 5) Selected policies that provide significant travel time improvements while keeping costs moderate; 6) Prioritized proposals with moderate sales tax (1%) that don't overly burden local businesses."
