    "disposable_income": "South Acres/Crestmont Park is a lower-middle income community with median household income around $35,000-40,000, indicating limited disposable income for transportation costs.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have relatively low discretionary spending power, making them particularly sensitive to increases in transportation costs and sales taxes.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited transit service with longer travel times, and while car ownership is common, many residents are transit-dependent and sensitive to fare changes.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Prioritized proposals with lower transit fares ($0.75) to maintain affordability for transit-dependent residents. 2) Favored lower sales tax rates (0.5-1.0%) to minimize impact on limited discretionary income. 3) Accepted moderate driving fees ($0.50) as compromise to improve transit service while not overly burdening drivers. 4) Sought balance between improved transit times and cost burden on community. 5) Selected proposals that reduce travel times while keeping combined costs manageable for lower-income residents."
