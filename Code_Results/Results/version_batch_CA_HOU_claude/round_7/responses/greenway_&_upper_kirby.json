    "accessibility": "The area has good road infrastructure and moderate transit access with multiple bus routes, though most residents rely on personal vehicles for transportation.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high income levels, prioritize policies that reduce travel time over cost savings 2) Support moderate tax increases that improve transit service while maintaining reasonable driving conditions 3) Accept higher driving fees to reduce congestion since residents can afford it 4) Prefer balanced fare structures that don't overly burden transit-dependent workers in the area 5) Focus on policies that improve both transit and driving times to benefit all residents"
