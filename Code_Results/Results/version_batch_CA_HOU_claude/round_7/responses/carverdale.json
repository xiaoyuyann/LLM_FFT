    "disposable_income": "Carverdale has a relatively low median household income around $35,000, with many residents working in industrial and service sectors, indicating limited disposable income.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Given the low income levels, residents have minimal discretionary spending capacity and are particularly sensitive to additional taxes and transportation costs.",
    "accessibility": "The neighborhood has limited public transit access with infrequent bus service, high car dependency for work commutes to industrial areas, and relatively long travel times to major employment centers.",
    "decision_rationale": "1. Prioritized policies with lower sales tax (0.5%) due to limited disposable income. 2. Favored lower transit fares ($0.75) to make public transit more accessible. 3. Considered moderate driving fees ($0.50) to improve transit service without overly burdening car-dependent workers. 4. Balanced travel time improvements with cost impacts on household budgets. 5. Selected proposals that provide the best combination of reduced travel times while minimizing financial burden on low-income residents."
