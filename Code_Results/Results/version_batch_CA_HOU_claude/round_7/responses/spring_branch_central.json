    "disposable_income": "Spring Branch Central has a median household income of around $55,000, placing it in the middle-income category for Houston with moderate disposable income levels.",
    "discretionary_consumption": "Residents have moderate discretionary spending capacity but are price-sensitive to additional taxes and fees given the area's working/middle-class demographic profile.",
    "accessibility": "The area has good road access but limited transit service, with most residents (85%) relying on personal vehicles for commuting while a smaller portion uses public transit.",
    "decision_rationale": "1) Given high car dependency, prioritized proposals with lower driving fees and moderate taxes to avoid excessive burden on drivers. 2) Selected proposals that balance transit improvements with cost impacts, as enhanced transit could benefit the working population. 3) Favored proposals with moderate fares ($1.25) to maintain transit affordability while generating revenue for service improvements. 4) Considered proposals that reduce travel times for both modes to benefit all residents. 5) Balanced the tax burden against service improvements, preferring moderate (1%) over high (1.5%) tax rates."
